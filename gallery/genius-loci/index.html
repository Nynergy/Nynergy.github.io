    <h2>Genius Loci</h2>
    <hr>

    <p>It seems like creating music is the only way I can convince myself to create artwork as well. Just like my previous set of digital pieces, <a href="/gallery/strange-negatives/">Strange Negatives</a>, this collection was inspired by some recent experiments with modular synthesis. In fact, the piece titled <strong>Rift State</strong> was originally meant to be the album cover for those songs. That music has not been abandoned, but this artwork has become something of its own, so I'm putting it here, under the name <strong>Genius Loci</strong>.</p>

    <p>"Genius Loci" is a term that refers to the "spirit of a place". In modern Western interpretation, the <i>atmosphere</i> of a location. Followers of this site and my creative endeavors know that I have a fascination with landscapes and the abstract nature they can represent, so this idea of a place's "spirit" instantly appealed to me. These nine pieces reflect various spirits or atmospheres created through the layering and compunding of simple images. Most are them are wallpapers, or other color-rich images that were manipulated until they emulated a foggy watercolor-esque texture. A slew of pictures I grabbed from the Internet, or have used as desktop wallpapers in the past. Each piece has an ethereal feel, swimming in colors and shapes, drawing the viewer's eyes throughout with strange pseudo-perspective.</p>

    <p>These are places that exist all at once and not at all. Everywhere you are and aren't, and nowhere you know or have never heard of. These places are silly little reflections of many lives and no one to live them. I hope you enjoy them.</p>
