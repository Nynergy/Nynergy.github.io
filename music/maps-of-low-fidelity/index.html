    A side project where I make shorter 5-track collections of sound, typically
    with a focus on evoking natural landscapes through generative composition,
    minimal voices, and simple atmospheres of soft noise.

    After hearing of the passing of Lindsheaven Virtual Plaza during the
    pandemic, I was extremely sad that we would never get to hear more of the
    minimal ambient work on 'Rainforest Hills'. So I set out to make some of my
    own work in that style, as much in tribute to the late artist as it was in
    practice for my passion. Eventually it spiraled into more than just a
    one-off release, and now I plan to put out plenty more projects under the
    MoLF name.

    You can expect a new MoLF project every six months, in March and September.
