'Thousand Wishes of Rain' is an album of music. It is a collection of longer
motifs, generative compositions, improvised passages, single-take performances,
embellished field recordings, transcribed emotions, colorful tapestries of
sound, transitory feelings, repeated memories, shifting drones, digital noise,
empty space, echoes of an unspeakable inner world, and the smell of rain as it
is still falling down. It is a series of wishes I have made, to remember myself,
to recall the natural world, to reveal what was once hidden, to repeat the words
never spoken, to rejoice. It is a love letter to you, the listener, the
wonderer, the humming shadow of leaves across the ground. 

Feel free to give it a listen, and hopefully you find something that reaches
you.
