                <small><strong>Inner Weather</strong> is my latest collection of ambient electronic tracks. Unlike my last release, <strong>A Dream of Shapes Returning</strong>, this album doesn't focus on tape loops - in fact, it doesn't use any at all. Instead, I decided to experiment with modular synthesis using VCV Rack, and these are the songs that came of it.</small>
                <br class="show-large"><br class="show-large">
                <small class="show-large">This album features some of my most direct tracks since my work under the Neuromelter name. However, it hasn't lost that meditative, somewhat delicate ambient style I cultivated on my last record. I think this variety adds a bit more character to the album, and keeps it from being too one-note. Just like <strong>A Dream of Shapes Returning</strong>, these tracks were all recorded and performed live, without the careful sequencing and automation of a DAW, and can be downloaded for pay-what-you-want on Bandcamp.</small>
                <br class="show-large"><br class="show-large">
                <small class="show-large">If you'd like to hear <strong>Inner Weather</strong>, you can listen to a track using the embedded player above, or by visiting my Bandcamp page using the button beside it. I hope you come to enjoy and appreciate this album in the same way I have while making it.</small>
