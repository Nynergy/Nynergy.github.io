You once told me, "The beauty of the world is the smell of rain on the wind,
like a color never seen." <br> <br>

What does that word, "beauty", even mean? I have never known such an emotion.
I've heard people use that word so much, I've found it everywhere, yet never
experienced its namesake. Where does it come from, what does it look like? Why
is it made out to be the origin of so much in this world? <br> <br>

People call things beautiful all the time. They call nature beautiful, though to
me it seems chaotic and stonefaced, as if knowing it will outlast us all. They
call their children beautiful, though they continue to dwindle. I will never
have children of my own, nor would I want them. They call other people
beautiful, be they family members, lovers, or their local breeding house men. I
know no family but the Church, and know "love" only by the name "Flesh". All of
these "beautiful" things seem foreign to me. Silly, inconsequential. Where is
the purpose in this beauty? <br> <br>

You would sometimes tell me about the things you had seen along the coast,
those fragments of memory from a time before you even knew to speak. Things
like colors and sunsets and great shining stars in the night. I've seen all
those things, yet I can't seem to find the same awe and reverence you find in
them. <br> <br>

Some days I feel the memory of that time is all you have left of it. Perhaps in
those moments I understand why you so fondly cling to the fragments; the smell
of rain, the color never seen. <br> <br>

But I want to find it -- this beauty. This world of beautiful things, I want to
find its purpose. And perhaps in doing so, I will find mine. <br> <br>

-- Clover
</div>

<hr>

The city stands like a gate in the evening. Between what was and what now is.
Even from this close, the silhouette of dark spires is still hazy in the warm
light, quickly turning orange, red, a burning purple. Onyx spines stuck straight
as arrows into the hard soil; hundreds clumped and scattered in patterns only
people could make.

Clover stands in the meandering breeze for a few moments, eyes closed. Searching
for something, a clue, a voice, an affirmation.

Nothing comes. Eyes fixed to the gate, Clover continues on into the shadow of
the city.

As the towers loom larger overhead, the fields of grass gingerly bending under
the breeze thin, replaced by small patches of crops, dusty footpaths,
half-dilapidated shacks that once may have been useful outposts. There's been no
war to speak of in anyone's lifetime -- only rumors and legends of battles from
centuries ago, the foolish crusades of a sinful people.

All at once, the outskirts of the city give way to the worn entrance, whose
extravagant and ornate design is not lost in the crumbling, eroded perimeter.
From a distance, the architecture of the Church can seem cold, angular,
brutalist; it hides the warmth, the age, the familiar and time-tested modesty of
its design.

Clover pauses beside a shoulder-height wall, feeling the face of the old stone.
Small pieces come away like charcoal where generations of rain and snow have
finally picked away at the smooth finish. It's said that cities across the land
used to boast walls taller than some mountains; now they present nothing but
rings and labyrinths of crumbling black slabs barely held together by ivy and
chance. The memory of safety -- the idea alone -- is enough.

Further inward toward the heart of the old city, scattered groups of people
wander the dusk. A pack of monks and priests clad in black robes gather around a
food cart, looking for the night's meal; a few common folk talk outside their
homes, enjoying the cool reprieve of the evening after days of scorching heat; a
pair of rearing house custodians usher a swarm of silver-haired children through
a courtyard gate, their calm, caring demeanor stirring up a slight homesickness
in Clover.

The feeling escapes as soon as it is felt, replaced by an urge to keep moving
forward, to the center of the city. A clue, an affirmation, like mist struggling
to keep its shape in the sunlight.

At a fork in the main street, the packed dirt gives way to worn cobbles
stretching like a circle around the wide common areas of the city. Rows of
stout towers give way to a dip in the earth, like a valley folding all the
buildings in on themselves. The architecture becomes more elaborate, robust, and
reminiscent of an older, more organic era.

The heart of the city, like most settlements of the Church, is dominated by a
massive domed building, menacing with spires and towers along its periphery. The
local house of worship, its twisting towers and spiraled keeps making it to look
like a mammoth creature, its softly glittering crystalline dome a hard-backed
exoskeleton.

The cathedral is certainly larger and more complex than any of the chapels or
tabernacles dotting the rolling hills of Clover's home. Clusters of local folk
wander about its base, enter and exit its towering mouth, congregate beside it
in market squares around dry fountains. Like small insects across the floor of
an enormous room, they walk from place to place.

Clover takes more than a handful of moments to internalize the enormity of this
structure which dwarfs the people below it; and even more enormous, the city
sprawling up and away from the giant crystal heart.

"Is this your first time in the city, young Sage?"

Startled, Clover turns to face the voice behind them, a tall figure topped with
shoulder-length silver hair. They wear a black shawl over their common garb,
much like the one Clover wears, buttoned once at the neck and again at the
chest. Their face is neither masculine nor feminine, and bears a disarming smile
beneath a pair of small glasses. Looking up at them, Clover tries to regain some
composure.

"Uh- why, yes. I've come here on my way to Zion."

The mention of that place raises an eyebrow on the stranger's face.

"Really now? Pardon my rudeness if I find that a little hard to believe. You
can't be older than sixteen or seventeen, by the looks of you; since when are
custodians sending you on your way at such an age?"

"Eighteen, actually, Sage. But I understand your disbelief. My custodians could
hardly believe it themselves when I told them I had felt drawn to leave the
house."

The stranger chuckles a bit at that.

"I can only imagine their confusion. I wasn't struck by such a mood until I was
already apprenticed to my local Haxei."

"So you've seen it, then? Zion?"

Clover's face lights up, but dims quickly as the stranger shakes their head with
a wistful smile.

"No, the mood only took me so far. I stopped here, and haven't left. My work is
too important to me now."

"Oh..."

The stranger walks ahead to where a switchback of stairs leads down the side of
a hill, looking out over the cathedral. Clover follows and stands just behind,
watching the people mill about the squares. The two of them stand in silence as
the night's lavender deepens.

"What's your name, young Sage?"

"Clover."

"And where do you call home, Clover?"

"Vax Isola, to the south."

"That's quite a trip, coming here from all the way down south."

The stranger turns their head to look at Clover.

"Tiria is in alignment tonight, so there will be a midnight service at the
cathedral. If what you say is true, and you're serious about finding your way to
Zion, then I hope to see you there."

"Of course, Sage! I'll be there, not a minute late!"

The stranger smiles at Clover's enthusiasm.

"Then, be at peace."

With a hand raised in goodbye, the stranger turns to the stairs and descends
toward the looming heart of the city. Through the forest of towers across the
valley, the twin moons can just be seen peeking over the horizon. Tiria's light
begins playing with the crystal surface of the cathedral, and Clover watches as
more and more people congregate in the square below.

_Midnight service?_ Clover's mind goes in a thousand directions. _Those are only
for elders, right? And that Sage wants me to be there?_ They stand there,
staring absently through the spaces between towers, tracing possibilities of
thought. _What do they want with me? Should I have said anything about Zion?_
Palatia peers around the edge of Tiria and they stare back at Clover without
answers.

_I don't even know the name of this place. What have I gotten myself into?_

Before the Flesh of doubt can creep further, they shut their mind. The color of
evening is gone, leaving only the dark of night. Windows in houses and towers
along the spine of the city shine yellow and white. The scent of someone's stew
wafts from the open window of a nearby house. A voice is carried on the slight
breeze up the hillside singing lullabies. Great shining stars poke pinholes in
the sky.

As they've done in many cities before, Clover searches the night for a rearing
house to stay at.

<hr>

The dark, wide doors of the cathedral stand open to either side of Clover as
they look up into the midnight sky. From beneath its massive face, the cathedral
resembles a palace more than anything else, the moons balancing on one of its
many towers; those towers now seeming like fingers of a dark stone hand,
reaching up for the twin satellites.

Around Clover, a small swarm of clergyfolk and black-shawled Sages steadily
filters into the building like a stream. Many laugh or make small talk, catching
up with acquaintances, exchanging information, passing the time before the Haxei
arrives for the service.

Within this river of strangers in a foreign city, Clover stands like a rock,
unable to step beyond the threshold to the vestibule. They watch as groups of
elders, Sages, and other high clergyfolk walk down the nave, finding spots to
sit. The doors hang overhead like sentinels, as if to question Clover -- _Do you
really belong here, young Sage?_

Swallowing the question before an answer can form, Clover steps across into the
vestibule. Without stopping, they walk down the nave and find an empty pew
toward the middle of the sanctuary. As they sit and wait for the Haxei to
arrive, Clover examines the room.

Where the outside of the structure seems stoic, towering, twisting, and dark,
the inside shines with a thin, graceful lightness. Detailed and delicate
tapestries line the walls, depicting religious events; lights are strung
lattice-like across the sanctuary, like a spider's web; the ceiling seemingly
floats in shadow overhead, higher up even than the sentinel doors; the columns
along the nave sport silver spirals of filigree; even the pews are cushioned and
comfortable. Not a hint of the exterior's dim, unforgiving nature remains.

The congregation undergoes a similar transformation; gruff elders laugh loudly
with each other, remembering days gone by; reserved clergyfolk take turns
exchanging gossip and news; even the stoic, "unfeeling" Sages can be seen
smiling above their shawls.

The warmth of this unexpected intimacy is cut with a brief, humid chill. The
elders still laugh, the clergyfolk gossip, but the air has changed. The Haxei
has arrived.

Down the nave comes a pair of Sages. The shorter of the two wears a black shawl
with silver hems and a dark skirt coming down to the sanctuary floor. Their
silver hair curls about the sides of their head, a slip of paper tied to a lock
near the left temple -- the Haxei.

They seem deep in conversation with their taller counterpart: the stranger
Clover met earlier that evening.

The two make their way to the raised dais at the front of the sanctuary,
ushering a wave of quiet as the Haxei takes their place at the pulpit. The
stranger stands just off to the side, eyes wandering over those gathered for the
service; they hover over Clover with a glint of recognition.

Someone closes the cathedral doors with a resounding clank that echoes off the
high ceiling like a cave. As the Haxei shuffles and prepares documents on the
pulpit, a soft redness comes over everything in the sanctuary.

Looking up, a crimson eye stares back down at Clover; Tiria's alignment throwing
a deep color through the crystalline dome overhead, coating everything in red.
Clover imagines the city outside must be drenched in a deep garnet light.

The thought conjures an image of the cathedral like a dark stone hand or insect
in a pool of blood.

A small cough from the pulpit dispels Clover's momentary anxiety; the Haxei is
ready to begin the service.

"Let us begin with a short word of known Wisdom."

They speak softly, as if tired or exhausted, but there is not a hint of fatigue
on the Haxei's face. Eyes closed, they speak the Wisdom from memory, unfurling
it like calligraphy off a tract. Elders and Sages alike can be seen nodding
along to the time-worn verses, some even closing their eyes and repeating the
Wisdom in tandem with the Haxei.

<div class="block-quote italics centered-text">
... <br> <br>

Though we are spread thin, we weave ourselves together <br>
Though we are made Flesh, we do not leave our Selves behind <br> <br>

Though Flesh may fall and rise, we rise and fall <br>
With it, and in time, without <br> <br>

To reach up for that Height, it will reach back <br>
And ask something more of us than we are worth <br> <br>

The Self beyond the tepid waters, draining in piety <br>
Revealed in Zion's light, as Founts overfloweth <br> <br>

Though we are led by aimless winds, we make our own purpose <br>
Though we are laid like vines, this earth across <br> <br>

We persist through time to become more than we are worth <br>
To give back to that which reaches down <br> <br>

To become outward, onward, and otherwise <br> <br>

...
</div>

Clover is so transfixed that they nearly forget to take out the leather bound
volume from their satchel -- a parting gift from their custodians. The book
contains tracts and passages of old Wisdom collected through time by clergyfolk,
religious officials, and even the Founts themselves.

Clover flips through the onion skin pages until they find the set of verses
being recited by the Haxei, following along as if in the middle of a morning
lecture. Something about the very traditional delivery of the passage sparks an
image of Clover's old Vaxei -- that hunched Sage who insisted on maintaining
classical interpretations of Wisdom, and who many suggested may be older than
the decaying tomes those very interpretations sprung from.

The Haxei comes to the end of the passage and opens their eyes, a small smile on
their face.

"We receive this Wisdom from those before, all the way back to Maven, the First
of the Founts. Now, let us reflect as They once did."

As per custom, the Haxei and congregation bow their heads in unison, and the
silence of reflection comes over the deep crimson sanctuary. Clover finds it
hard to reflect amidst the feeling of watching eyes; the stranger, the crimson
moon, looking at a child in this place of elders and officials.

The paranoia lasts for only a minute, until the Haxei collects their documents
from the pulpit and moves aside to let the stranger take their place. The
congregation sits upright at attention, as the red glow from above begins to
wane.

Clover's curiosity is piqued; normal services end after the moment of
reflection. The Haxei will dismiss the congregation and everyone will filter out
of the sanctuary. But none of the elders or Sages have moved from their seats,
and the stranger looks ready to hold another service of their own.

When the redness has been leeched from the sanctuary, the tall Sage leans on the
glass pulpit and begins addressing the congregation with a casual voice.

"Alright, we'll start with a quick recap of the last meeting."

They begin listing off items from an old meeting agenda: public projects,
expenses, trade reports, various civil complaints and concerns from locals. The
air of the sanctuary has softened, somewhat; even though the talk has now become
rigid and filled with unknown jargon, the congregation seems in a lighter mood.
As the stranger begins taking comments and reports of news from various elders
in the front pews, the Haxei quietly steps out through a doorway obscured by a
set of drapes, into some back area of the sanctuary.

Seeing the stranger left to handle the meeting alone, Clover realizes something;
this Sage must be the Haxei Moia, serving as mediator between the Church and the
people of the city.

The meeting continues on for quite some time, the Moia fielding questions from
elders and clergyfolk, delegating duties to officials, discussing plans of
action for a host of civil projects -- even laughing and joking along with the
congregation, like a group of old friends. Clover can't follow most of it, but
they gather that the city, called Hax Fara, is struggling with the population
crisis, much like many of the Church's settlements.

Declining numbers have left some residential areas abandoned, nobody to live in
them; there isn't much consensus as for what to do with the buildings or land,
and it doesn't seem that much progress is being made in this meeting.

Clover recalls the crumbling walls outside of the city, the stretches of ivy
barely holding some sections together. The image of the city's dark skyline
against the sunset takes on a new meaning in their mind; the gate swings open,
empty and wide, no one to keep watch, no one to close it.

The meeting ends, the Moia dismissing the congregation and the great doors
swinging open with a rush of air into the night. Clover feels that sensation of
being watched, and notices the Moia's gaze hang over their seat among the pews.
The tall Sage gives a soft smile as they adjust their glasses, and exits through
the same curtained doorway the Haxei used. Clover can't help but feel compelled
to follow them.

After waiting for most of the elders and Sages to clear out of the sanctuary,
Clover stows their leather bound volume away and heads to the back, behind the
dais.

<hr>

Brushing the curtain aside, a short hallway stretches on for a few meters, a
handful of rooms connected on either side via doorless openings. Most are dark
and filled with worn shelves, dusty boxes, reams of old paper, and stacks of
books. A soft amber light spills out from one room at the far end. Walking
toward the light, the scent of dust and ink is almost overpowering.

Through the brightly lit entrance is a small windowless office. Tapestries like
the ones in the sanctuary line the otherwise austere walls, and a rugged wood
desk takes up most of the space in the center of the room. The desk is covered
in papers and books, two ink wells with two different quills, a selection of
opaque, jagged crystals, and a single lit wax candle. In the high-backed wooden
chair behind the desk is the Haxei, and standing to their left is the Haxei
Moia, both of whom meet the anxious gaze of their visitor.

"Well hello there, young Sage," says the Moia. "I was hoping you would find your
way back here. Don't be shy, come in." They wave their hand inward and Clover
timidly joins them in the dusty office. The Haxei's soft smile is calming, their
voice like a velvet hand.

"So you must be the pilgrim Veren has told me about. It's true, you look quite
young to be traveling to Zion."

Clover's gaze wanders over the various items on the Haxei's desk, unable to meet
their eyes; the eyes that see the child, the novice, still without a solid grasp
of the earth and its energy.

"Don't seem so sullen, now. Tell me, young Clover, how is it you found your way
to Fara? Are you not traveling alone?"

"...I am alone, yes. I was drawn here, by a mood. An intuition."

The Haxei pauses, as if hearing those words echo for a moment.

"I see... and what do you make of this mood?"

"It's difficult to say, I'm afraid. It was laid upon me in a dream."

Both the Haxei and the Moia, Veren, perk up at the mention of a dream.

"Tell me about this dream, young Sage. I'd like to know the things you saw."

"...Well, it was a cool spring night, not more than a few months ago..."

<div class="block-quote">
...and Clover found themself in a vast plain of dust. In every direction, the
world lay dissolving, decaying into motes rising up in the failing light. The
horizon burned like a halo around the earth. <br> <br>

A slow pulse began to rise. The air itself breathing thoughts. Ideas ran down
Clover's spine. Flashes of feeling and visions of an aching nothing. A growing
vacancy, like a voice's diminishing echo. <br> <br>

The burning world like a beating heart, crying out. Dust rising up into the sky
like sands of an hourglass in reverse. A wicked light like fire dancing among
the grains, leaving ash and darkness behind. <br> <br>

Nothing remained of that place but blackness, and within it, a voice like the
humbled earth, speaking in tongues...
</div>

"...and when I awoke, I felt the urge to leave. I tried to ignore it for days,
but I could take it no longer. By the dawn of a week beyond that dream, I was
already on the path north to the nearest settlement."

The Haxei takes a moment to digest Clover's retelling with closed eyes, and
Veren speaks up.

"The urgency you feel is unmistakable. In fact, it reminds me of my own
experiences, the fervor of my journey, as short as it may have been. Chrys, how
do you feel about this young Sage's story?"

Slowly, Chrys lets out a quiet sigh and opens their eyes.

"Young Clover, I feel you are on the path to something greater than yourself.
But I also fear that, being so young, you do not comprehend the danger of this
journey; and I don't just mean the harshness of the wilds."

Lifting away the slip of paper tied to their hair, Chrys reveals a great white
scar along their left temple. The air of the small, stuffy office becomes
heavier, thicker with dust.

"Once, I was in your position; a bright-eyed Sage of twenty-seven, traveling to
Zion with a fellow Sage. A friend, drawn by the same mood you feel. We had
walked many miles through the stone fields, many more than we should have in the
thick summer heat. To escape the harshest of the weather, we set up camp in the
shade of a shallow ravine. In the night, I awoke to the sounds of a scuffle, and
found my friend being eaten by one of those... creatures."

Chrys's velvet voice begins to tense and harden as they recount the horrific
event. Veren stares at the tapestries on the wall with dark, absent eyes, not
the first time they've heard this story. Clover struggles to take in the weight
of what has been said.

"I tell you this not to give you a fear of nature, young Sage. Quite the
opposite."

The Haxei taps the scar on their head.

"This is my reminder. A reminder not to fear the earth, but to fear oneself.
When I saw what had become of my friend, I was filled with rage. A bloody,
burning rage which I had never felt before, and have never felt since. I
unleashed wickedness on that creature in an act of revenge, and in doing so, the
Flesh took hold of me. In my rage, my power betrayed me, and left me wounded,
unable to continue my journey."

Chrys waves their hand over the crystals on their desk.

"These shards are from that very ravine where I nearly died, and serve as
another reminder that I must never give in to the follies of the Flesh."

Clover continues to process the Haxei's tale, managing to formulate a single
question.

"So, you've never been to Zion, then?"

Chrys shakes their head with a small, wistful smile.

"No, I have not. But, I have faith you will, young Clover. Hubris is as sure a
killer as any of the nastiest creatures you may find out in the wilds, but I
hope you will not encounter the same pitfalls as I."

A moment of silence hangs in the candlelit office as the Haxei unties the slip
of paper from their hair.

"This slip contains a tract of Wisdom very dear to me. It serves as a third and
final reminder that I am still not yet the Self I must be. Even a Haxei like
myself struggles with the Flesh, and the process of personal evolution is a slow
and troublesome thing at times. But, it is at the core of who we are as a
Church. It is the heart that gives us life."

Chrys extends a hand across the desk, offering the tract to Clover.

"I want you to have this Wisdom, and be confident in its truth. As your mood
guides you to Zion, let this guide you to your Self."

Clover hesitates, staring at the paper in the Haxei's palm. They look up at
Chrys' face, as if to ask for further permission. The softly smiling Sage simply
nods their head once in return. Clover takes the slip and places it in their
satchel.

"...I will see this journey through to Zion, Haxei. You have my word."

<hr>

The lights are all out at the rearing house above the lip of the valley.
Clover's room is small and contains only an old wooden desk, a squeaky metal
frame cot, and a window the size of a dinner plate. The window is cracked half
open to let in what little breeze remains of the night, while Clover sits
cross-legged on the cot, examining their belongings.

Traveling light, the young Sage has little to their name; after all, only the
bare essentials have been needed to camp along the roads between settlements. A
bedroll, an old map that has proven to be largely inaccurate, the leather bound
volume of Wisdom, and emergency rations for long stints between rearing houses.
Now, Clover adds the Haxei's tract to the spread of items on the guest room cot.

As tired as Clover feels, sleep will not come; between the residual nerves of
their talk with the Haxei and the thought of another apocalyptic dream, rest
seems far, far away. Instead, the words on that little slip of paper continue to
roll through Clover's mind.

<div class="block-quote italics centered-text">
We are here not to promote or complete <br>
But to explore and reach out into those spaces <br>
We never imagined could exist within ourselves <br> <br>

In this exploration, we go on forever <br>
There is no end to the Self <br> <br>

Finding your Self can be difficult <br>
The Flesh is like a thief in the night <br>
And your body is a temple filled with the loveliest gems <br> <br>

Too many are distracted by the beauty of <br>
Completion, of the result, of the end <br>
But that is a foolish pursuit <br> <br>

To search for the Self is beauty <br>
To unfold that endless plain within you <br>
And discard the corrosive shawl of the Flesh <br> <br>

Frustration is endlessly looking for a beauty <br>
That isn't there <br>
But so too can there be a hidden path, an unseen fold <br>
As simple as a thought, as small as a budding flower <br>
That will blossom into a new beauty <br> <br>

Keep searching
</div>

The words are handwritten in neat script, and appear without any name,
signature, or attribution. They appear in no recorded texts Clover has ever
read, and may very well be an original tract written by Chrys, or perhaps a
transcript of unrecorded Wisdom passed down through word of mouth by the elders
of Hax Fara.

Regardless, the slip of paper feels like a message, or a friendly conversation.
Clover cannot stop hearing the passage read aloud by a familiar voice, and their
mind turns to a scene from many years ago...

<hr>

<div class="mirrored-text">
A chill mist begins making its way up the hillside along the edge of Vax Isola.
Noto stands out on a rearing house balcony, facing the dark waves of the coast,
foam as gray as the overcast sky. <br> <br>

Clover walks up and silently joins the silver-haired custodian. Noto makes no
move to greet the child Sage, continuing to face the vast southern ocean. Their
worn purple scarf wraps around their neck, keeping the encroaching chill at bay.
Clover follows the custodian's gaze and watches the waves travel in and out.
Finally, after a few minutes of idle watching, Noto addresses their visitor.
<br> <br>

"What do you see, Clover?" <br> <br>

"I see water. Everything is gray." <br> <br>

"And what else?" <br> <br>

"...Nothing. It's all gray." <br> <br>

"And beyond it? What color do you see?" <br> <br>

Clover squints hard to see through the veil of dull clouds over the sea. Not a
single boat or bird, all the villagers have gone inside to escape the oncoming
rain. A tinge of frustration sets in. <br> <br>

"I don't get it, Noto. I can't see anything but gray. What colors are you
talking about? What am I supposed to see?" <br> <br>

"You must use more than your eyes, little one." <br> <br>

Clover continues to watch the tide ebb and flow in rhythm. They focus on the
rushing sounds of the ocean, the damp feeling of the coastline. Nothing comes.
<br> <br>

"What do <i>you</i> see, Noto?" <br> <br>

"I see a simple beauty." <br> <br>

"...Beauty? What's beautiful about this place?" <br> <br>

The custodian turns their head of long silver hair toward Clover. Their eyes are
cloudy and empty like the sky above.  <br> <br>

"The beauty of the world is the smell of rain on the wind, like a color never
seen."
</div>

<hr>

The memory of Noto wracks Clover with another bout of homesickness. With time,
the feeling fades, and as the sluggish breeze makes its way in through the small
window of the rearing house guest room in a foreign city so far from the coast,
Clover manages to sleep peacefully.
