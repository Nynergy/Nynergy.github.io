Welcome to <strong>Lexica Chromatica</strong>, an online archive/blog for "Poetry, Music, and Other Strange Scrawlings".
</p>
<p>
This site will serve as a landing page for all my creative projects, including poetry, prose, music, blog posts, digital artwork,
and perhaps much more in the future. Updates may be sporadic, I tend to upload new posts when projects finish, or when it
particularly strikes my fancy. If you have any comments, questions, enlightened ideas, ill-formed music opinions, philosophical
advice, literary/life-choice recommendations, bones to pick, or winning lottery numbers, please don't hesitate to send them to my
email at bsbuchanan99@gmail.com - alternatively, you can write them on a piece of paper, tape that paper to a brick or large rock,
and throw it through my window. If you do so, please also attach a check that covers the cost of window repair.
</p>
<p>
Thank you.
