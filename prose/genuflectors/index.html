<p>In X amount in time as flowing by in spurious memories. These neurons firing
rails of light. Corrupted state, reset. These are the documents. Your
correspondence is appreciated. Borealis songs skipping school girls. Screwed
in the metal ground. Here where there is somewhere other before remembering in
scraps of flaming photographs. The gun barrels pointed fingers accused. Glass
people glass churches prone under the bridge gazers. Jumping. Smaller
crucifixes growing. Mark the spreadsheets hanging over after lifters raising
limbs from earth. Suits sparkle dull boys parking outside the scene. We live
here drinking tumbling what was that. Quick dry facade painted over.</p>

<p>Come listen in. Speaking tongues and teeth. These people are not to be
trusted. They are within and without us.</p>
