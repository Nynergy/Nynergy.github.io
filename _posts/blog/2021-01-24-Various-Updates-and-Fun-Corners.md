Time for more fun updates from a man without anything better to do! That's
right; it's time for Ben Buchanan's ___Lexica Chromatica Web Development Update
& Other Miscellaneous Bullshit Corner!___

## Website Update

Keen-eyed visitors of _Lexica Chromatica_ (all 0 of you) may notice some new
styles and content that's been added to the site recently. I finally nailed
down a list of things I wanted to change or add to the site, so I went through
and did it over the weekend. The changes include, but are not limited to, the
following:

- Navbar Style & Placement
  - The navbar text is recolored to be more aesthetically pleasing and readable.
  - The top navbar has been moved outside the masthead and the gradient now leads into the navbar background.
  - The current page is now also highlighted in the navbar with a "filing cabinet-esque" tab pattern.
- Poetry Page
  - The books in the right hand column are now presented in proper cards.
  - This card style is more uniform throughout the site.
  - Book cards include links to Amazon, and to PDF downloads.
  - Page header and rule now span entire page width, like other pages.
- Gallery Page
  - Individual galleries are now presented in cards, like the music page.
  - Galleries now have short descriptions on the main page instead of just on their individual pages.
- About Page
  - Tons of content added to the about page.
  - Presented in stacks of rows with alternating directions.
  - Added a simple "mailto" contact form at the bottom of the page.
- Quality of Life (AKA _Oooh Shiny!_)
  - Table entries now have smooth transitions when hovered over with the mouse.
  - Navbar tabs also have this effect.
  - So do all the buttons on the site.
  - I may have been a little bored and added it to a lot of stuff.

So yeah, the site is looking more and more like a proper website on the
Internet. You know, like all those other unknown, one-man, abstract creative
archive websites with poor color coordination, lackluster development, and
frustratingly slow posting habits.

## Project Update(s)

I've been spending a lot of time working on a new collection of poetry that
will hopefully come out sometime before I graduate this Spring. I don't know
how long it will take, as I've only just collected all the pieces I want to put
in it. I still have to edit, organize, style, reorganize, rewrite, fret over,
and give up on perfecting the pieces in the book, and I'd like to make some
sketches or other artwork that finds a place inside the volume as well. Much
like my last collection, __Another Flow__, I'm using LaTeX on the command line
as my typesetting tool of choice.

For a small taste, here's a piece that will appear in the collection, titled
"Yure(i)mono".

```
Deep green night
yawning wide
with mist
around the teeth

Eyes of the world
glazed over
for thousands of
small moments
already gone

Outside the blue crystal
headlights flare
streaking by the road

There is a spirit flashing
a light into my window

Faint beating pulsar
reaching through the mesh
without words

Her beam grasping straws
from a stranger
without reason

A cipher wound up in
a dress of smoke and
pale leaves

Dying grass under solid
gunmetal clouds

Ancient future rain drying
before it falls in a mad
dash for more time

What is she saying?
What is she saying?

Waving back and forth
back and forth
in a swaying trance
of lights

Trying not to be seen through
so easily
```

Besides the new collection in the works, there are a lot of little projects
still floating around, in a limbo state while I decide which one I actually
want to work on. I still want to continue playing around with modular synthesis
and make a new electronic album, I still want to learn more Perl and make a
cool tool or program that uses it, I still want to write up a new list of album
recommendations for people to look over. And all of this sits on top of an
ever-growing series of books, music, and anime that I still have yet to
consume.

I continue to write poems, and I have a lot of ideas for prose swimming around,
too. Hopefully the site sees more of those narrative pieces, I enjoy writing
them.

That's about it. Not much else going on. I got a new chair for my desk. Not
like anyone wants to read about that. Feel free to contact me with that form I
mentioned in the Website Update section.
