After many months of curating, editing, formatting, and stylizing, my second collection of poetry, __Another Flow__, is now available for purchase on Amazon. Containing almost a full year of material from me, it's nearly triple the size of my previous collection, __Babylon Effect__. Experiments with concrete form, collage and blackout poetry, collaborative efforts from the talented Ashley Markowicz, and all of it compiled on the Unix command line with LaTeX. Weeks of perusing TeX Stack Exchange posts, designing the internal layout of the book, ordering and editing the pieces, every second of tedious double-checking has led to this final product, and I could not be happier with it.

Of course, I imagine only a handful of people will ever read it, and even fewer come to appreciate it the way I do.

Below is a small taste of the nearly 300-page volume, a single piece titled _Your Lungs Are Jet Engines_.

<h3>Your Lungs Are Jet Engines</h3>

<div class="block-quote">
In October your leaves go black <br>
Hair dripping in the shower <br>
Steaming shoulders <br>
Heavy and wet <br>
Bulldozing paths through crippled trees <br>
Lining graveyards and boulevards <br> <br>

You gaze through walls <br>
What do you see there <br>
Between the layers of paint <br>
Meticulous lives seated in comfort <br>
Stoic in austerity <br>
Thriving off of a sentiment <br>
Stuck in between your bones <br>
A sediment of belief slowly wearing you away <br> <br>

Along that idea of winter paths <br>
Inhaling the crystal snap of cold <br>
Your lungs are jet engines <br>
Restraining the pealing sharpness <br>
A yell or a scream or a sob into nothing <br>
Your shoulders behind you <br>
Nothing ahead <br> <br>

Air humming November commercials <br>
Through your frozen TV screen <br>
Counting daisies in your lap <br>
Softly purring <br>
Shaking like cats <br>
Why are you shaking <br>
It’s nothing so big <br>
Or dramatic <br>
As that <br> <br>

Sitting in low light between worlds <br>
You’re pressing your luck <br>
Like flowers between dog-eared pages <br> <br>

Save some luck for me <br> <br>

~ ~ ==== ~ ~ <br> <br>

Cling to something <br>
Hold it within you tightly <br> <br>

If you keep it warm <br>
Like an egg <br>
It will hatch <br> <br>

And if you open it <br>
It will unfurl until it meets <br>
The edge of the earth <br> <br>

Do not let it stop
