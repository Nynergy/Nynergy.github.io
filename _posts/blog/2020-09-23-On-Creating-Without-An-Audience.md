Lately I've been trying to get back into the rhythm of the creation process. To create is second nature for me, it's as integral to my being as eating and sleeping. When I neglect the need to express something, it gnaws at me, like a hunger. But that hunger has been hard to come by in the past month or so.

Being in quarantine isn't a strange phenomenon for me. I'm used to the idea of being alone, isolated from other people. To be one in my own little sphere of existence, taking in my surroundings and pulling out expressions generated from that input. But after some time, it's worn me down. Perhaps I'm just becoming more 'mature' (read 'scatterbrained'), but I feel like I'm missing something important to my work. Something important to my experience in life, which I had before, but no longer do.

This isn't an irrevocable absence, though. Not some loss of innocence or mental capacity. It feels more like I've dropped something I was using, and now can't locate it again. Some catalyst I was bound to in my creative endeavors. I don't know why, but that catalyst seems to have gone for the time being.

Creative efforts rise up and sputter out before they can come to fruition. Older ideas and projects sit idle, rotting or otherwise collecting dust. Scattered poems repeating themselves, vague notions of prose concepts, unfinished demo tracks for a new album, hastily constructed attempts at digital artwork, numerous poorly-crafted code repositories, all of it accumulating this _cruft_, this _lack_ of presence. Like I can't find the motivation to return to it, or when I do, there is no time to make it happen.

One thought that continues to pop into my mind is that I have no audience. Nobody but friends and family, and even then it's an audience of vague understanding, present more out of perceived obligation than an actual vested interest. My first collection of poetry, _Babylon Effect_, only sold 7 copies by the time I published my second collection, _Another Flow_, and I even made fun of that fact in _Another Flow_'s About the Author section. At the time of writing this, that number has risen to an astounding 8 copies. And don't be fooled, I've lost more money on those books than I've made. Writing, crafting, and publishing them cost me absolutely no money whatsoever, but I've spent more money on author copies to give to people than I've made back from sales (including the sales of _Another Flow_, I might add).

So then, _what's the point of it all?_

Well, I suppose for some people, the answer would be that there is no point. Some creators crave appreciation, an audience, the satisfaction of reaching someone outside of themselves with their expressions. And I suppose that those things are all true for myself, but they are not the do-or-die priority of my creative work. For me, creation is a ritual, a way of being. To call it a religious practice might not be too far off the mark, but I prefer to think of it as instinctual. Like I said earlier, _second nature_.

I create out of habit. Out of necessity. Out of being. And sometimes that leads me down strange paths that go nowhere. It leaves my expressions without structure, without reference to reality. A floating concept without relatable meaning. That's why I've been trying to work more on my prose writing skills, and specifically write about settings and situations that reflect the world around me. My poetry has always been a very direct outlet of my personal inner thoughts and feelings, but my prose is meant to be more of an expression of the things outside of me, filtered through my personal experience and worldviews.

In the grip of quarantine, my experience has been one of constant solitude, facing friends and family through the Internet, while taking on wave after wave of possible-COVID-patient customers at my cashier job. Recently I got a programming position at a department on my university campus, but even that is done remotely. The world has slowly slipped into an image beyond windows and screens. So what am I left with to write but a relentless series of small poems and prose concepts, each one regurgitating the same stale angles and ideas on isolation that every writer and poet with an Instagram account can come up with?

Yet create I continue to do. Slowly, and quietly. I write to no one, and no one writes to me. This is the way it has always been, for as long as I can remember creating. I write only to myself, holding my work to no standard other than my past accomplishments. In an empty amphitheater, all I do is try to perform more loudly than my echoes.

Perhaps I'm getting tired of that chase. But I don't see that stopping me from creating. Just as all those creative projects are growing stale and rotting, I too will rot without them. That is the purpose of my creations, to continually peel back the old layers and reveal something more about myself that I hadn't known before.

Honestly, I'm not sure where I was going with this post, but I don't mind rambling from time to time. What you've read here is a part of the creation process.

Something about it reminds me of cleaning cobwebs off of some sleeping machine.

Sorry about all the dust floating around.
