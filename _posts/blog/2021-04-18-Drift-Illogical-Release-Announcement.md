I've returned from a world of radio silence, to announce that my third volume of
poetry, __Drift Illogical__, is finally out. These pieces were written and
assembled during the COVID-19 pandemic, and serve as a kind of counter-balance
to my work in __Another Flow__, as well as a capstone to a trilogy of poetry
collections; I discuss this further in the book itself, so be sure to read if
you're interested.

As I mention in my closing remarks of the book, I plan on creating a second
edition of my first poetry collection, __Babylon Effect__, in order to update
the styling and provide some additional content to the otherwise thin volume. So
look forward to that sometime in the future.

Below is a piece that appears in __Drift Illogical__, titled _Weather Fold
Shutter_.

<h3>Weather Fold Shutter</h3>

<div class="block-quote">
Our words pass between clouds as lightning <br>
Diffused off our coils <br>
Empty ballpoint pens <br>
Stuck like spears through breaks in the sky <br> <br>

Anvil tops rolling carried by geese in arrowheads <br>
Those thunderous passages we splayed out <br>
Washed and drenched in our amateur passion <br>
Soaked into the soil <br>
Draining away <br>
Folded into trees and weeds and other <br>
Smiling blooming beasts <br> <br>

And we in love with love take steps <br>
Walking beaches and banks of rivers <br>
Creeks and streams in sunlight <br>
Like lovers do <br>
And we split like pods of seeds <br>
In the wind <br>
Along hillsides and dams <br>
Into cities and public parks <br>
Where we rest <br> <br>

Over valleys in rose <br>
Or mountain ridges chrysanthemum <br>
All things open up <br>
For us in time <br>
In time <br>
So we wait <br>
So we sleep <br> <br>

And our dreams fold in on themselves <br>
And our minds fold like mirrors and gems <br>
Harden angles and lines <br>
And our voices fold stories into pieces <br>
Repeated through time and again <br>
Over and over <br>
And our children fold paper dolls <br>
With our faces <br> <br>

So we fold rain charms for now <br>
As the passage continues outside <br>
String them up in a row <br>
Wait for our storms to subside <br>
And we rest under blankets of night <br>
Beneath years of traveling light <br> <br>

;;';'';'';;';';';;''';''';'';;;';';; <br> <br>

Those storms of our youth are gone <br>
And now rain is a passage of time <br>
Planting seeds before winter's rime <br> <br>

Blowing over our heads in flashes <br>
Spinning spirals and spores born into light <br> <br>

A fading light coming down <br>
And we move on <br> <br>

We read back those passages we remember <br>
The ones where we said <br>
"It's alright"
