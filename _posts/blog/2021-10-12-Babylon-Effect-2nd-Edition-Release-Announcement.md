After much procrastination, the new edition of __Babylon Effect__ that I
promised earlier in the year is now finished and available on Amazon. This
edition features all the same content as the original release of the book (with
_very_ minimal changes to the published pieces), as well as a pair of appendices
containing unpublished material. All of this sits on top of some updated
styling, which is meant to emulate the kind of typesetting and design I used for
__Another Flow__ and __Drift Illogical__.

Below is a piece that appears in <strong>Babylon Effect: 2<sup>nd</sup>
Edition</strong>, titled _Make it Last_.

<h3>Make it Last</h3>

<div class="block-quote">
Bending like spaghetti <br>
Snapping steel cables on carriers <br>
Clear the deck <br>
Or lose your legs <br> <br>

— <br> <br>

As I bag groceries for strangers I find a certain lightness of being. In that
moment, nothing matters to me except the safety of those bananas and dinner
rolls. Surely if I were to drop an egg or a bagel I would cease to exist
entirely. For what else is my purpose? <br> <br>

— <br> <br>

Brushing aside fearful confirmation <br>
Biases of birth <br>
Belonging in arms of cosmic flux <br>
Changing and shifting like <br>
Fluid under tumultuous moonlight <br> <br>

Do you look up at this same storm <br>
As it reflects the Sun back into your eyes? <br> <br>

— <br> <br>

I haven’t really grown much at all since I left high school. I still believe
that those people I see as friends will remain in this place of
understanding. And perhaps they design their own futures in such a way, but
just as circumstance guides my feet, it guides theirs. Abstract directions
that don’t always seem to exist within our frames of consciousness. <br> <br>

I miss the sultry summers where the wind <br>
Would blow them my way. <br> <br>

— <br> <br>

It’s just talk <br>
Mouth foaming with filler <br>
Filtered out all the reality <br>
Without considering the innate art <br> <br>

— <br> <br>

Between you and me, there is a secret beginning in my existence, like a shadow
on reality that I cannot see over my shoulder. The shadows of spindly trees
tickle it as I wander, telling me that there is a reason for this flood of
a strange feeling. <br> <br>

Staring out of windows at such a velocity, there is death waiting at the end of
the line for your head. Stare softly with me, now. Make it last.

If you'd like to support me by purchasing a physical copy of <strong>Babylon
Effect: 2<sup>nd</sup> Edition</strong>, you can find it [on
Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Babylon-Effect-2nd-Ben-Buchanan/dp/B09HR6QBF8/).
As per usual, I've also provided a full PDF copy of the manuscript, which you
can download for free by clicking
[here](/poetry/Babylon-Effect-2nd-Edition.pdf).

I've begun working on some more music lately, so hopefully you'll see the fruits
of that in due time.

Thank you for reading.
