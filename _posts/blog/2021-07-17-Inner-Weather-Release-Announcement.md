## New Album

I've finally found a home for all the samples and demos I've been collecting
over the past two years: a new album of ambient electronic music, which you can
download for pay-what-you-want on my
[Bandcamp](https://benbuchanan.bandcamp.com). I've also added an information
card to the [Music page](/music/index.html) on the site, so feel free to check
that out.

<strong>Inner Weather</strong> is a new batch of ambient electronic tracks, this
time focusing on modular synthesis with VCV Rack. I decided to challenge myself
and make an album without the use of a DAW, and my interest in eurorack and
modular collided with that idea to create this new album. Feel free to give it a
listen and let me know what you think. You can listen to one of the tracks below
using the player.

## Other Stuff (Name Pending)

As per usual with me, I've been slacking on writing. I was too hell-bent on
finishing the album to bother with short stories or Petrichor Sacrament. I find
it hard to create something original or compelling enough whenever I try to sit
down and make progress. Perhaps in time something will come of those loose
threads.

After completing the album a part of me just wants to sit back and relax and not
worry about creating more things right now. I almost feel kind of creatively
drained. I find myself spending time playing more video games, or binging my
backlog of shows to watch.

I have been writing the occasional poem, or working on small applications here
and there, but that's about all I feel I have the attention span for at the
moment. As always, creative seasons come and go with me; this is just another
season of waiting and recharging.

If you have any questions about the work I plan to do, or if you'd like to
harass me until I get off my ass and make something else, then feel free to
contact me. Thanks for reading (and hopefully listening).
