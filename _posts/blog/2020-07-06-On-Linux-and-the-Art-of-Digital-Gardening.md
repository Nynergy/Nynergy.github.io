_Digital Gardening_

It's a concept I've had in the back of my mind for quite some time. Certainly I'm not the only person to have come up with such an idea, for it does not seem like a wholly original one. I treat my computers like gardens; each one is like a little digital ecosystem, and it is my responsibility as its caretaker to tend to that ecosystem, and work toward its health. Like a Buddhist monk in a zen garden, I grow, prune, and organize my systems in such a way that benefits not only me as the end user, but also the system itself and how it interacts with internal files, packages, and data structures. By working on systems in this way, by giving them the care, attention, and respect they deserve, one will find that the world of computing opens up like a flower in the light. You begin to understand your system on a deeper level, how it functions, where it finds things, where it stores information, how it interacts with the end user. And through this understanding comes a kind of peace. A joy of maintaining a system, a landscape in its own right.

My computer systems, especially my Linux systems, are a landscape of my own design, an environment for me to explore, build, and understand. I find joy in tending to these systems, and lately my silence on __Lexica Chromatica__ is largely due to this work. I recently purchased a new laptop after using my old $400 HP Notebook for the last eight years straight as a daily driver. Two years ago I set up a dual boot on it and began running Ubuntu alongside the original Windows 8.1 OS. This new machine, a Dell XPS 15, came with a fresh install of Windows 10, and I've been hard at work setting up a virtual machine on it to run Linux.

That VM is where I write to you from now. This new system is called _Apparition_, named so because it is a VM sitting on top of my Windows host, instead of a dual boot on the physical hardware. It's like a ghost that exists as a layer on top of my base machine, but it is no less powerful. _Apparition_ is built on Gentoo Linux, a more advanced distrobution that focuses on minimalism, deep levels of configuration, and building packages from their source code. This ethos is something I've wanted to play around with for quite some time, so I'm excited to be using it now.

Much of the system is similar to how my other Linux machine, _Progenitor_, was configured, although there are far less packages on _Apparition_, and I hope to keep it that way. I'm using i3-gaps as my window manager, vim as my editor of choice, lf for browsing files, calcurse for my calendar and TODO list, htop for system monitoring, and neomutt for checking my emails. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to install qutebrowser for browsing the internet due to some issues with the QtWebengine, but I was able to install firefox and add the tridactyl extension, which emulates the vim-like bindings of qutebrowser near-perfectly.

Overall, I'm very happy with how this new machine is running, and I'm excited to see where it will take me in the future. I've included a screenshot of the main workspace as it exists now, you can view it at [this link](/blog/Apparition-Workspace-July-2020.png).

If you have any questions, comments, or otherwise regarding my thoughts on digital gardening or my new Linux machine, feel free to shoot me an email at bsbuchanan99@gmail.com and I'll get back to you as soon as I can.

Thanks for reading.
