It's been quite a while since I last posted anything to the main site. Since
then, I've been busy adding some extra new content, writing, making music, and
trying to be an adult with a full time job. Time for a rousing session of
___What Bullshit is This Guy Gonna Regale Us With This Time!___

## New Content

After many years of kicking around some ideas in my head for a fantasy story,
I've finally begun working on it. [Petrichor Sacrament](/petrichor/index.html)
is now actively being written and serialized on a subsection of Lexica
Chromatica, which you can find under the Prose tab, or by clicking on the shiny
link I put a couple dozen words ago.

Of course, by "actively" I really mean "whenever I feel like writing it", but
who's actually paying any attention here?

In all seriousness, progress on Petrichor Sacrament will be glacially slow, I'm
sure. When not working on that story, I have plenty of other short story ideas
that I want to start or continue, and possibly compile into a book. I want to
focus more on my writing in the future, as I feel I've been slacking on that
front lately.

I'm also in the middle of putting together a second edition of my first poetry
collection, __Babylon Effect__. That one is a bit less of a priority for me, but
it also doesn't require me to actually write any new content, so it's appealing
to my lazy sensibilities.

## Music

I've mentioned it in other places on the site, but I've been playing around with
modular synthesis and making some demos and ideas for another ambient electronic
album. I don't know if that will be finished any time soon, but I'm liking the
progress so far. I may post some of the demos to the site in the future if I
feel happy enough with them.

## Being a Productive Member of Society

So I've got a full time job now! I'm a developer for the IT group on campus at
my alma mater. Oh yeah, did I mention I graduated? Funny, that. I'll be
attending grad school in the fall part time while I work on campus, so it
doesn't really feel that special quite yet.

Working a full week is nice for the more rigid schedule, as I feel my schedule
has been a bit too fluid and aimless during quarantine. Time slips by without
realizing, and I tend not to leave the house unless I have to go somewhere for
work. As a result, I'm ~~slowly but surely regressing into~~ a shut-in
teleworker with no social life.

Quarantine has really affected how I feel about myself and my work, both
professionally and personally. I've become lazy and filled with doubt about the
worth of my creative projects, unsure of my own capability to continue making
something with meaning. Professionally, even though I've landed the full time
position I wanted, I still feel like I haven't proven myself as a developer. A
part of me understands that I will always be plagued by that feeling of
inadequacy, so I want to look past it and just focus on my work. Hopefully that
won't be too difficult a task, especially once we move back into offices and I
don't have to work from the same room I live in.

## Thoughts (Quickly Melting)

It's very hot today, even after the sun has set. Or rather I should say, it's
far too _humid_ in my room without any A/C. Only a cheap floor fan I have stood
up on a chair in front of my half-open window.

I've always found it so strange how my feelings on seasons have changed over
time, and even within each year. During the winter, I hate the cold and wish for
summer to clear away the drab gray skies. During the summer, I dread the
humidity and crave even a small cool breeze. When you're a kid you love summer,
because it's the only vacation you really get. But now as an "adult" (whatever
that means), I don't get vacations. Only the heat. Heat and time slipping like
melted ice.

The older I get, the more I prefer spring and fall.

Summer used to be the most creatively rich time of my life. Vacation was my time
to experiment with mediums, throw caution to the wind, make whatever struck my
fancy. Now I feel like I sometimes need to drag the words out of myself, force
motivation out of nothing. I guess that's why I so desperately want to get back
into writing, and add more posts to the site. I want to return to some part of
myself that I left behind before quarantine.

Perhaps that's the sentiment at the core of my recent poems, which I seem to be
writing less and less frequently these days, especially after publishing __Drift
Illogical__. Feel free to read my latest piece
[here](/poetry/2021/06/27/All-Ive-Left-Is-All-I-Have).

That's all I really have to say today. Nothing of any real consequence, it
feels. But it's words on the site nonetheless. Something to cut my teeth on as I
get back into the swing of things. Let me know what you think, if you please.
