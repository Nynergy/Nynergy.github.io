Tumbleweeds continue to roll by this cyberplaza I call home. But for a brief moment, they stop.

The collection in question, __Genius Loci__, can be found [here](/gallery/genius-loci/), or by going to the gallery page on the site and navigating to the appropriate gallery link.

Here's a peek at one of the pieces, titled __Rift State__:

Just a small little creative outburst before I go into hibernation again while the semester rages on. Let me know what you think of the work if you like. Thanks.
