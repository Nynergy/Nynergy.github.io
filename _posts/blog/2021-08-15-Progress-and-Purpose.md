Let's talk about __Lexica Chromatica's__ new look, and try to decide why the
site exists in the first place.

## Styling Changes (!)

After rocking that deep purple/maroon kind of look for a while, I decided I
wanted to change things up. I really liked how the colors and overall aesthetic
worked for [Petrichor Sacrament](/petrichor/index.html), so I decided to
replicate it for the main site. The base color is the same, but the links and
accent colors are red instead of green, and I've updated the mastheads to match.

Page headers now also feel a bit more central, and pop out more. I like how it
looks at the moment, though I may do a bit more tweaking in the future if I find
it isn't quite what I had in mind.

## Progress (?)

Speaking of Petrichor Sacrament, where the hell is the next part? Well, I
haven't written it yet. Not a single word. I have it planned out, for the most
part, but I just haven't found myself in the right headspace to sit down and
hammer out a prose piece in a while. So it'll have to wait.

A lot of personal projects have been hitting the same wall lately. I haven't
done any work on programming projects (other than this website, which hardly
counts in my opinion), I've made minimal progress on the second edition of
__Babylon Effect__, I've written a handful of small poems (the latest of which
you can read [here](/poetry/2021/08/15/The-Girl-With-the-Painted-Eyes/)), and
I've left a few scattered short stories unfinished or unwritten, to name a few.

But I do feel like I'm making progress in other things. I'm finally finishing
some video games I've been meaning to play for a while; I'm watching shows I
never got around to before; I'm taking more time for myself without feeling the
need to incessantly create and craft something "profound" or "important" or
"expressive".

Sometimes I just want to sleep in and watch cartoons all day.

## Purpose (...)

So what do I plan to do in the future? I don't know. I keep telling myself I
need to put more time and attention into the site and all the projects that
populate it, but I've found words are a lackluster motivator.

In the past, when writing poetry, I found that my most productive times were
when I was working with a predefined list or set of prompts, each one
representing a poem that needed to be written on a certain day, regardless of
how I felt or what happened earlier in the day. Perhaps I'll fall back into some
kind of rhythm like that, but instead of poetry prompts, I'll make a list of
goals and projects that I'd like to have finished at a certain time.

In the future, I'd like for __Lexica Chromatica__ to be a place where I push
myself and see what I can accomplish. When I created this website I meant for it
to be a repository of my personal projects and thoughts, but going forward, I
want it to be more of a personal playground.

I want to have fun messing around with this space, pushing and pulling it until
it becomes something more than just some dusty digital library. Yell at me if I
leave this place silent for another few months.
