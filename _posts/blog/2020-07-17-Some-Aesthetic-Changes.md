You may notice that the site looks a little different than it used to. I decided I wasn't quite happy with the way the posts were being presented in lists, so I took the time to create and style some tables for them. Now you'll be able to click on a post in the table on the home page, poetry page, prose page, and blog page. I've also included a column for post categories on the home page, so that you can easily see what kinds of posts are most recent.

I'd like to make some changes to the other pages on the site, like the music page, the gallery, and the about section, but I'm not quite sure what I want to do with it just yet. In the meantime, let me know what you think about the new changes. I'm very happy with how they turned out myself. Also, if you have any ideas as to how I can further style the tables, or style the remaining pages, toss those my way.

Thanks for reading.
