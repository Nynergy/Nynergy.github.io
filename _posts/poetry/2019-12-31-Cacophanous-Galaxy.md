Calmly now <br>
It begins to course down the pane

1. Spiral arms in grass. Cupping the dandelion. Devil's paintbrush poking out. Always smiling, those red indigo hooks for teeth. A binding light. Grounding. Over the smokestacks and chimneys. Swiftly. A switchback on a hill. Lines running down. Carrying power. Carrying water. Carrying me. Coiling in on the courtyard. Glass people in a glass world. Wind chimes for limbs. Hearts for heads in sagely robes. Where the yellow rolling growth rolls over in the wind. Not a cloud in sight. Between the poplars. In the shade there I am sitting. I am sitting and nothing more. I am not waiting. There is nothing to wait for. It is all here and now.

	((( (( ( ) )) )))

2. In the city of rain there was nothing more than water breaking us all down. But here there is light. And sound. And something yet buried in the still air, humming a tune around the corner. It knows a timeless patience. But it is also here in my palm. I wait for nothing more. Under great walls and towers, falling from the silver arms, these are all bad dreams of those without open eyes. Here is the sunny road. Here is the steady wave. Here is the chorus of summer. Moving with you as you move around it. Surround it. A confounding light. Hiding. A timid companion. A smile in the window.

	((( (( ( ) )) )))

3. A puzzling look. The pieces all dissolving in the tide. Drawn out into that place we cannot reach. Broken bits melting down. Forget the shattering. Forget the scattering. Remember warmer days. Curling in on themselves before the Sun. The dreams have all gone from here. There is only the here and now. There is only this place we have always known. No longer attached to those dark clouds or statue gardens. Daydreaming in glass rooms over the sea. Humming a tune around the corner.

	((( (( ( ) )) )))

4. All the trenches of the valley in silverlight. Dozing off into another year. Hillsides playing tag in a gymnasium of colors. All the paint dripping down. All the people moving in an ocean of commercials and paychecks. A young man in a rickety old chair slamming the keys before Christmas. The air stirring around the base of Library Tower. My door is open even when it is closed. Thinking in new languages.

	((( (( ( ) )) )))

5. The sound of the creek behind the house flowing after heavy rainfall sitting on my desk. The orange lamp clashing against the blue LEDs on the walls like antipodal spirits. All the old photos in negative color sitting on my hard drive. The cords all tethered into some electronic hydra in hibernation. The blanket sitting on my recliner.

	((( (( ( ) )) )))

6. It's all spinning down. Slowing up. All those memories of steam, drifting along the mountain spines. I watch the Sun burn them away. They are already gone into the self-sustaining fabric. The shawl you wear. The smile you keep in a box for special occassions.

	((( (( ( ) )) )))

7. Stitching horizons together. An endless road into the sky. All the people singing hymns in their sleep. Why are they crying. They are all dressed in black only for today. Tomorrow is a new day.

	((( (( ( ) )) )))

8. Stretching out a canvas. Painting with light. In the trees. Over the houses. Stained glass.

	((( (( ( ) )) )))

9. Still life grinning at me. I smile wider (than I used to).

	((( (( ( ) )) )))

10. Do this for me, will you.

Remember the world <br>
In all its noise <br>
And light
