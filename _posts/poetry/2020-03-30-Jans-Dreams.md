Down at the end of the hall <br>
Acrylic petals fall <br>
Ing off the stems like au <br>
Tumn shades or specters

Curled up fetal drying dying wait <br>
Ing for Mother’s love mandate <br>
Hands scooping up fragrant life

Dreams logician puzzles gleam <br>
Like breams in water beam <br>
Ing smiles back up into the sheen <br>
Of light like solar skin thick layers keen <br>
On tipsy tilted lovers seen <br>
Together last remembering forever

Memories making webs of meaning

,;’,;’,;’,;’

Burnt golden frames in blazing luster <br>
Wooded capsules rectangular clusters <br>
And canvases in mustard <br>
Boxes with painted prints and youngster <br>
Desires in still life pining

Something older she trapped there <br>
With stems and stamens and pistols for hair <br>
In the wind lighter than whispers where <br>
Whipping by thoughts of light are common

Is common <br>
To believe in a dream you keep having <br>
Keep giving

‘;,’;,’;,’;,

Grassy dew clinging dropping pianos <br>
In early sun like your father’s and his father’s meandered <br>
Remembering of time before they thought it mattered <br>
They just hunt and gather <br>
Early man woes

Clay pots and soil brimming <br>
Grinning through the green beginning <br>
To poke through the base bringing <br>
A smile to her spirit

And her specter hands drift over the canvas <br>
As she whispers a petal unfurling
