Two red moons <br>
In a thick mud dusk <br>
Mostly darkness and <br>
Humidity

The girl with the painted eyes <br>
Like a moth’s wings <br>
Sits and sees <br>
With her antennae <br>
As I drink my water

I am the room temperature <br>
The critical mass of mist <br>
The white noise of the fan <br>
Spiral born black around my bed

She is the electric hum of the lamps <br>
Ruby glow on a face she’s never seen <br>
Or maybe never opened her eyes <br>
To find

The heat wraps <br>
Like a leather cocoon <br>
And I drink my water <br>
As she sees into me

And I sit in her space <br>
Around like a ring <br>
Meditate her <br>
Between my splayed fingers <br>
In a dance

I am the web caught in myself <br>
And wonder if my eyes <br>
Quickly closing <br>
Are painted <br>
Like hers
