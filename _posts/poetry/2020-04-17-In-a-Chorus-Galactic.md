Born dancing in ritual orbits <br>
Around great pillars and beating heart anchors <br>
Hands in arpeggiated waves blinking <br>
Eyes in alignment with a far off presence <br>
Thousand yard stare

Golden doorway light stuck to the floor <br>
Wrapped across the corner of the room <br>
Sticky veneer <br>
Jungle of stains and polish and glue <br>
Brushing over all the organic shapes <br>
With squares and microchip patterns

We are much better at closing than opening <br>
Curling in to that great sheet <br>
Folding in to that warmth craving company <br>
We are much better at holding on than giving up <br>
But only if it doesn’t get too <br>
Cold

Out there <br>
The ring of light around the empty space <br>
Cities of DIY people <br>
Stapled creased at the corners crimped and taut <br>
Smiles acrylic and primer in the wrong <br>
Order

Don’t go where you won’t return <br>
Unless you don’t plan on <br>
Coming back

Born dancing those ancient steps they all took before us <br>
And we are clapping in circles <br>
Shattering the air with our many layered voices <br>
In a chorus galactic <br>
Speaking in tongues of paths never taken <br>
And when we come to that place we have never been before?

We multiply over the leaves like rain <br>
And so many bugs making sheets of noise <br>
In the pitch hot summer nights <br>
Like a swarm of music boxes in a tar pit

Flashing our heaving heavy light over the trees <br>
They don’t want to see our glass eyes <br>
So far removed from that mother cloth <br>
We were cut from

And we keep dancing in rooms and chambers <br>
The same words coming out our mouths <br>
Just with different letters <br>
Strange science of impressionistic thought becoming lexical axioms <br>
Making laws out of happenstance

Remember that we are ideas made <br>
Tender flesh <br>
Skin and stems and joints and petals <br>
Curling in without that dance

Keep sprouting worlds from your trunk <br>
Spreading far from where you were planted
