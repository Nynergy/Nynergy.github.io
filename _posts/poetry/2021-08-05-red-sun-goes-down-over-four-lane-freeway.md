atmospheric shimmer a few degrees above the horizon line <br>
as i sit and breathe <br>
and become somewhere else <br>
in my long black sedan

the whine of my engine <br>
like a child never grown <br>
beyond an echo of my own <br>
maturity

a scaffold of thought <br>
like stones balanced <br>
considering mutual identities with zen <br>
and the uneasy bond of nothing with <br>
eternity

snapped branch on the road <br>
after a storm <br>
what does it see

does it see

flare of a red sun like a ring world <br>
hula-hoops my skull <br>
like a time i once felt <br>
and have thought about <br>
maybe once or twice <br>
or more <br>
but no more

sunburned across my forehead <br>
sunken into my empty vessel <br>
every moment on a roulette wheel <br>
spinning

that scaffold shudders <br>
in a cold that is not there <br>
but i am somewhere

at the movies in the summer <br>
or the Cyber just before winter tightens <br>
in the lens of a setting day <br>
or the words of a closing chapter

in the water of a dream <br>
that i clear from my throat <br>
as the morning birds wipe my mind <br>
as autumn drives closer to the center of this place <br>
where we sleep with <br>
each other

along the four-lane freeway <br>
we set with the star <br>
spinning down slower and slower <br>
growing red and old

i sit in my long black sedan <br>
and breathe the cold air of my a/c <br>
and wonder

what will i do <br>
before i wash away
