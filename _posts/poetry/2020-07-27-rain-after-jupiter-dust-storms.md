Bloom, bloom, under the storm that <br>
Flooded out the little birds <br>
Fresh from eggs <br>
Never seen

Burst, wild from corners and other <br>
Solitary confinements <br>
Padded with your <br>
Excuses and <br>
Forgetting

Frantically, freakishly, take in the fold <br>
The cloth you know, you see <br>
Around your ears and <br>
Many faces

Resting, breathing, beneath the golden hour <br>
Under the layer of night slowly <br>
The layer of night <br>
Slowly <br>
Keep going <br>
Breathing in <br>
and out <br>
and sometimes <br>
otherwise

briefly, sidewinder noises whizzing by <br>
speeding by dripping listening <br>
to your dreams like <br>
boiling fevers

listing, empty houses, shuddering in the rain <br>
vacant air playing making dances <br>
in your hair <br>
t h e :: s m e l l :: o f <br>
j u n i p e r :: b e r r i e s

( o r :: j u p i t e r :: d u s t :: s t o r m s )

-=+=-

There is a silence in empty sanctuaries <br>
All around

Do you hear it?

The rain sometimes comes over the garden <br>
After I've already watered it

Do you find it funny?

I do

Nature is a thorough thing <br>
Haphazard from every angle in spirals and beams <br>
In patterns of salmon scales and clouds like whipped cream

A natural system of fullness and schemes <br>
Like meandering streams <br>
Into death

And then it all opens up again like a flower

Do you see it? <br>
Do you see it like I do?

-=+=-

grow, merge with this being completely <br>
for it was complete before <br>
we came here

it knows we are here <br>
with it
