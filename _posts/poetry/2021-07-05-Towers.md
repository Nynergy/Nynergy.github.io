Sun rhythm humming <br>
Burning bulbs hanging dripping dew <br>
Like drooling spiders <br>
Many eyes <br>

Clouds all sunburnt bleeding light through <br>
Like mesh <br>
The crows drinking into their <br>
Pitch dark feathers <br>
Like plants <br>

Sumac burning blooming maroon on the side of the state route <br>
To Ithaca <br>
Like crimson eyes towering over other <br>
Wildflowers <br>

There is our bed in the earth <br>
Up high in the towers of nature <br>
Or a natural dream <br>
Sleeping beauties us we and you me <br>

zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz <br>

Something of the light infects us <br>
Our melting sorrow shrinks <br>
Until tomorrow <br>
Holding up the hope <br>
Like Sisyphus <br>

Sun bleed in rhythm <br>
For a little while longer <br>
As I sleep in <br>
Your towers
