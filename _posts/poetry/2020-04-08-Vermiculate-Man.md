Tessellations reorganizing mirror worlds <br>
At the edges sewn with pine needles <br>
Wisps of misty eyes in the center of <br>
Clouds in the rye waving ritual dances <br>
Like movers and shakers

The oceanic plates and tides behind me <br>
Washing around the barnacle struts and buoys <br>
Slick ropes like orchestral shows <br>
So far behind me <br>
So far now

A blackening desert before me <br>
The Sun a helicopter hovering <br>
Murky pond of the sky moving in molasses rivulets <br>
Your flowers just the scent of my mind <br>
I do still remember <br>
I do

Chart my prints <br>
Map my voice from the time streams I came from <br>
All the way to this corner of my galaxy <br>
Forming of melted glass casted in sleep <br>
Nocturnal cranium crucible

Cast your rays from behind the whirring blades of the Sun <br>
Beyond the cockpit coming down <br>
Take up my noises in your wind and scatter them across the dirt of the planet <br>
Carry my dreams in their cryptic skins and trace the vermiculate patterns of their surface <br>
I am doing all this for you <br>
I am

Through the sand beyond the mountain ridges <br>
And back to the sleeping cities in gray and white <br>
Drink our tranquility light <br>
Deep into the night <br>
Collecting fires like brush chandeliers

Come douse me <br>
I will wait here for your liquid spirit <br>
I will
