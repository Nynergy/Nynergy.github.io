Black streets fanning out <br>
Ripples through the patches of trees <br>
We keep <br>
Between the brownstone blocks <br>
On fire <br>
In heat <br>
This bleeding body <br>
We keep <br>
Kicking around

The windows smashed <br>
The cars upturned <br>
The magazines emptied <br>
Fueling anger as it burns

A quiet smile peeking through the clouds <br>
Evaporated in TV cameras <br>
Dulled in social media stories <br>
In the night they stand on shaky legs <br>
And bay at the moon <br>
The white moon <br>
Hovering over <br>
Since time began

Gas canisters and rubber bullets <br>
Litter the ground like birdseed <br>
From government feeders

Wrappers and plastic reminders <br>
Glass shards and sooty lots vacant <br>
Under towering buildings still stood <br>
Fortress-like defending the cowards <br>
The ill-raised wielders of power

In their world of nests <br>
Filled with eggs <br>
Paper thin excuses <br>
And <br>
Ideologies

Between the green where we breathe <br>
Growing beams of comfort we beam <br>
Our teeth whiter than their eyes <br>
Whiter than Deathâ€™s demise

We will grow plants above <br>
This spinning planet <br>
And make nests in the stars <br>
Every ball and chain left <br>
Far <br>
Far <br>
Behind
