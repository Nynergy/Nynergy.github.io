Paper people folding feet across the miles <br>
Tiled and rough with facsimile stone <br>
Pushing dripping carts in a storm of <br>
Fear and ages of denial

Fighting nothing but themselves and the people <br>
They remember themselves being <br>
Some time <br>
Ago

It was <br>
Only a <br>
Moment <br>
...

A sheet pulled across the face in the <br>
Endless plexiglass reflections <br>
Down rows of register lanes under lights <br>
Decades after installation

Receipts left empty or tossed in a blue bin <br>
Softly curling and waiting <br>
But no one will <br>
Read them anymore

Do those walking memories remember their amounts? <br>
Do they know the tax or the thinning discounts?

Right next to the thought of a sunny day <br>
On 5th Avenue, <br>
Or the country of another name

A repeater of lullabies from mothers <br>
Who died so many years ago <br>
It’s a miracle these memories are alive <br>
Still themselves

Shuffling limping behind stout carts with only <br>
A half gallon of milk, a half loaf of rye bread, <br>
And half a newspaper with <br>
Half the words in red

.      .      .

We are only moving forward here <br>
Never backward <br>
Never still <br>
Only ahead

Under lights and masks we are moving ahead <br>
Before we can get our wits about us

Time is leaving us like a trail <br>
We are sometimes not the feet but only the <br>
Prints left behind <br>
Sometimes

Shuffling days we remember like murals <br>
No one else can ever see
