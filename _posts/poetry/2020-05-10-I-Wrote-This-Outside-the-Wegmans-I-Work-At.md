We’re all caught in the flaring tendrils of uncertainty <br>
Under the blaring PA of holding calls and summons <br>
The belts turning around the rollers, the vacuums whirring <br>
The guiding spirits posted at the corners in gold trimming

It snowed a couple days ago <br>
Some patches of the lawn are still white <br>
It’s May 10th today <br>
Mother’s Day

The birds are talkative in the morning <br>
I wish I could eavesdrop on their conversations <br>
Like a small stream winding underneath their <br>
Ancient syllables <br>
Taking in the plosives, the formants, the canyons of tone <br>
In a time of growth

Something is blowing across the parking lot <br>
But there is no breeze <br>
A visiting mystery walking a dog <br>
A line of cars waiting for the drive up service <br>
A list of people who didn’t get their flowers today

We ran out last night

Such a strange concept <br>
To run out of flowers

The tree not 20 feet away is still <br>
Blooming

How silly
