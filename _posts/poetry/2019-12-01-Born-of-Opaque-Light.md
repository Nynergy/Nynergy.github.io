There in the morning's song
faces rising apparitions lulling you
from some unknown dream
you cannot forget

Beyond the hills carrying metal pylons
strung up in winter laces and lights
between the trees where trains of
ghosts do roll on silent wheels
their memories a solid pane of gold
splaying itself on the remnants of
night's open breathless fields

Where Merwin watches the calendar
wilt and birds leave him behind
the flowers are still growing in
color

The wilds, the nature, the organism
growing, self-sustaining, birthing
in rituals of contact and
thusness

A thrush becoming a memory of
ancient trees
singing

---------------------------------------------------

That memory, that idea
of spring and summer
even autumn drifting into
colors

Burning in white fire
snow so young yet so old and
dead

A world in sleep paralysis
sweating and freezing

Everyone is closing their
doors and never
changing

Sleeping to be born again
