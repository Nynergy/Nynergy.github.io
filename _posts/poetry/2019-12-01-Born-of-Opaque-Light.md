There in the morning's song <br>
faces rising apparitions lulling you <br>
from some unknown dream <br>
you cannot forget

Beyond the hills carrying metal pylons <br>
strung up in winter laces and lights <br>
between the trees where trains of <br>
ghosts do roll on silent wheels <br>
their memories a solid pane of gold <br>
splaying itself on the remnants of <br>
night's open breathless fields

Where Merwin watches the calendar <br>
wilt and birds leave him behind <br>
the flowers are still growing in <br>
color

The wilds, the nature, the organism <br>
growing, self-sustaining, birthing <br>
in rituals of contact and <br>
thusness

A thrush becoming a memory of <br>
ancient trees <br>
singing

-

That memory, that idea <br>
of spring and summer <br>
even autumn drifting into <br>
colors

Burning in white fire <br>
snow so young yet so old and <br>
dead

A world in sleep paralysis <br>
sweating and freezing

Everyone is closing their <br>
doors and never <br>
changing

Sleeping to be born again
