The birds moving around poles of light streaming down <br>
Searching rays scanning shores and radar bays bouncing signals <br>
Back and forth in pen pal signatures <br>
The sealed and hidden questions moving through their secondaries

Where the dead yellow grass begins breathing <br>
Softly again <br>
That is the letter splayed naked with the words going down the throat of your mind <br>
There in a new spring light

Along the mudflats and reed soaked marshes <br>
Making little prints slowly subsumed by the caressing form of the wet earth <br>
Small beady eyes watching migration routes <br>
From cascading northern peaks to western ridges rolling in fields of dust and deserts <br>
Cotton moving in patterns across the sky <br>
While weeds whisper below of <br>
Nests and sandbars and empty meadows beneath hanging garden lightfields at night

Looking up at platinum spatters <br>
Through a memory of willow vines <br>
Something moves around the grass blades <br>
Towing solitary minds

And the moon pulls the Sun around in rose spirals <br>
And it shines between the lines
