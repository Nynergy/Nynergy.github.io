Your hand in the door <br>
    Holding something open in the light <br>
Shining beams through lenses <br>
  Other worlds in slanted shapes and names <br>
Becoming the petals creeping peeking out <br>
      Through the ice and stubborn <br>
Mannerisms

That raining sunlight coming down <br>
Remember me in angled colors <br>
Do you remember me there? <br>
Do you remember my shape?

Lanterns hanging swinging dripping warm <br>
    Ideas down the slopes we made <br>
Us kids beating down the grass <br>
  Watching it bend back up slowly always <br>
Watching is and learning is and <br>
      We is there and then was gone <br>
We can’t go back to that <br>
 All our droning memories like sugar <br>
A slurry in the sky dissolved <br>
               As <br>
                                  Clouds

Terrace steps along the coast <br>
The amber wisps above the waves saying <br>
Hello there good morning <br>
Nice weather we’re having

Soft shells <br>
Beating blood organs <br>
Breathing in and out in a natural rhythm <br>
You know this phase <br>
Nature’s flock of time in feathers falling <br>
On your face <br>
In molting

Buzzing Sun and Humming Moon <br>
    Holding hands back in September <br>
Making rose fruition moves like dances <br>
  On park benches in high heels <br>
All barbs and leafy shadows

Holding hands back in <br>
        Whenever <br>
Where the door of light <br>
Shining stratified along across the tides <br>
Remembers shafts of foamy night <br>
   It felt alright <br>
 It was alright <br>
It was

For a time

And all things are moving <br>
Along

As they

                      Do
