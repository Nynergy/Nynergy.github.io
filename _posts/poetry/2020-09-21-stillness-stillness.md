stillness stillness <br>
and scavenger rain <br>
gone away again

the water's gone and <br>
moonlight song <br>
and singing lullabies <br>
for sleep

but sleep avoids <br>
and dances sunlight dawn <br>
the yawning goes <br>
and goes and goes <br>
but not away

just awake

stillness stillness <br>
moving wild <br>
like beasts of mind put out <br>
to pasture <br>
and graze on the vine

i grow from my <br>
brain <br>
stem <br>
stalk

the little seed of a <br>
micro man <br>
making micro <br>
things growing <br>
oh so slow into <br>
micro beings

living color seams <br>
like ravines in the world <br>
showing stars in the black <br>
stillness stillness <br>
moving undulating <br>
or maybe crawling climbing <br>
your summit <br>
your peak

your limit

stillness stillness <br>
buzzing worlds <br>
buzzards whirl <br>
tasting futures <br>
in your whorls

my fingers somnambulized <br>
like spirits <br>
drifting <br>
and glowing eyes <br>
in glassy rags and ties

i'm sleeping stillness <br>
stillness sleeping <br>
in my arms <br>
a quiet leaping <br>
up and <br>
up and <br>
up and

and <br>
and <br>
and

always something more <br>
never <br>
stillness <br>
stillness

only drifting <br>
drifting <br>
in that bay <br>
don't think that i've <br>
forgotten
