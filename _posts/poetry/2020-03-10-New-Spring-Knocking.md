Freeway sounds <br>
Cruising by the empty strip mall lots <br>
Under the overpass and <br>
Over the underpass <br>
And passing the time under the open sea <br>
Floating over the microbiomes <br>
Like streets and houses in water <br>
Under tides and earthquake bunkers

Empty fields and retaining walls <br>
Tohoku matter slowly regrowing <br>
In terrapin turns and memories

Terrarium heaving against the glass <br>
Breathing mass green and gold and old <br>
And waiting since time starting spinning out from the center <br>
From the heated cocoon of origin <br>
Into the cold reaches <br>
Colder seasons <br>
Reaching out from dead dying trees <br>
In yellow green buds <br>
Blooming

Blooming <br>
Again

Like <br>
Before

In pearlescent strings along the wires <br>
Streamers steaming pavement weavers <br>
Stars and other alignment wavers <br>
Flapping banners blackness sheens <br>
And pointillist dreams <br>
In new magic beams

Coming <br>
Down

Sun driving posts of light <br>
Into the soil

We can climb <br>
Up
