Stale air dreams rafting choppy summer nights <br>
Beyond the lights of bell jar harbors <br>
Those luminous eyes of wrath <br>
Scraping the sea for a mark

A floor fan propped up on a CD rack <br>
Pulling languid oxygen through a window <br>
Cracked a couple inches on the hinges

Spiral forms colliding galactic centers <br>
Supermassive facets maligned bed partners <br>
All those brassy leaves coming down <br>
The trees in Belden

All the pointed fiends riding natureâ€™s death <br>
Into my mouth <br>
Like snow

Melt on my crucible kissing <br>
The earth

Dust and light and transit lines <br>
Curling around the spine of the city <br>
Concrete glass brains storming sparking <br>
Sending signals to the mothership <br>
That alien phase you know <br>
You know its face <br>
Well enough

The guide of its eyes and the caverns of its <br>
Vacuous questions

Fever dream speculations <br>
Sweating out the suspicions <br>
Through storms of attrition <br>
And tempestuous drones

Through the mesh of my window screen <br>
Sucking in the gleaming air <br>
Black and filling with lightning bugs <br>
Taking flight in the darkness

Remembering the weeds with their touch <br>
Their gentle clutch <br>
Holding your world which you stole <br>
From them <br>
Which they stole from the ether

And the ether stole from an understanding <br>
Beyond our own

Beyond those luminous eyes of humans <br>
Breathing and wondering <br>
In the thick summer air
