Deep jade walls in the earth looking out over tracks strangely zigging and zagging looking for purchase up the steep ravine walls. Streetcars and monorails making transits from top to bottom. Windows with purple curtains. People in the TV, in bed, staring from benches on boarding platforms. Bright white eyes looking. Still. Above. Floating there in glass rotundas. Buffets and beaches and groves of reeds spinning slowly like chandeliers. Pagodas climbing terraced switchbacks. Electric moon on a pole above the sky. All the pipes and wires sticking out of our capsules. Our machinery bunkers beating hearts. All the glass temples. Vacation laboratories. Plumes of fire spilling from the cracks. Sulphuric delight. Tours every hour. Two beds and a stocked mini fridge. Complimentary snacks ($10.00). A full bath with 30 sliding doors. Geometric configurations contemplating on the toilet. Never leave for the ice machine. Rainforest hills curling over the precipice. Drooling down dipping toes in the heat. Saliva loam dripping. Mother Natureâ€™s love invading. Exotic snapshots in their cloud storage. Never filtered; never liked. Brains in the palms. Beaches thinking for you. Sun never going down in the glass. Sand never dropping. Pink and orange petals licking at your virgin conviction. A green morality. Meet and greet at the lobby. Friendly uniforms. Serrated keycard smile. A grin from long ago. Been here a while. Riding the tram. Plastic seats. Plastic in heat. Capsule collider. Strapped in waiver solid copy diver. Into a lens of starlight. Myelin sockets sparking snapping. Capsule cracking. Chaplin laughing. Kill switch black and static.

Heat through blackout curtains. Single threaded metamorphic purpose. Free continental breakfast. Memoryless.

Nothing more than joy.
