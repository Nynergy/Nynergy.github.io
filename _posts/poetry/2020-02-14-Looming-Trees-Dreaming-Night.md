Staring motion sensor offline <br>
Silent windchill negative <br>
The day in a box with ribbons <br>
Clear blue top <br>
Amber shadows dancing cannot stop

Holding hands with chickadee memoirs <br>
Little branches children reaching out <br>
Perched and ready <br>
Listening in sunrays <br>
Making eyes at glass reflections hoping for a return <br>
Some days

Humming footbridge tunes <br>
The water underneath gentle strumming <br>
Taking our force out <br>
And floating on <br>
And on

Our words making divots scoring lines <br>
What I meant back then <br>
Means nothing now <br>
And what Iâ€™d like to say <br>
Is a windy day <br>
Through turbines spinning

A gentle hum between power pylons <br>
Loosely strung in pearls and finches <br>
The summer sun in garnet glare <br>
Behind the tree line stare

Her feet moving beyond the green <br>
Turning away toward the face of the wind <br>
Away toward the end <br>
Or the exit of your planet <br>
Still spinning in her absence

Night below zero <br>
Motion frozen staring at nothing <br>
Clearest biting weather <br>
And the multitude is turning above <br>
Without a care <br>
Like a flock of stars and crystal feathers
