hollow core whispers skittering across the dust <br>
to my fingertips fleeing some <br>
quietness i cannot <br>
extricate

labyrinth walls unstill <br>
dancing carnations about my static position <br>
wrapped around each limb <br>
each an incision <br>
filling up

== + ==

failing light in the empress seat <br>
gaze down at me <br>
down at me <br>
in little marbles of joy <br>
scatter along my shored mind <br>
buried in brambles of love <br>
reaching out for <br>
someone

this time alone waving a hand in <br>
goodbye but never leaving

returnal wave of teaching slowly <br>
brushing fingers along my face <br>
i know this fuzzy <br>
feeling <br>
like amber afternoons

== + ==

i do not know what it is to be sad <br>
like they know

== + ==

strange wondering crane <br>
perched on rocks and hard places <br>
under my dim light

day breaks the river <br>
flowing over smoothing her <br>
and flying away

strange wandering crane <br>
coming back to see my light <br>
with a puzzle box

== + ==

luna moth <br>
in porcelain hands <br>
sleeping a peaceful dreaming away <br>
away away

swift dark night sweeping us on <br>
against chainlink fences <br>
above a sea of crystal webs <br>
pulsing

the world opened up <br>
seeing the crease pattern <br>
lines of her hand <br>
grasping needing <br>
some thing

== + ==

pond life on my mind <br>
growing algae layers <br>
simple organics

you cross my ripples <br>
in a lazy gondola

i cannot bring my hand <br>
to break your placidity

we sit and grow <br>
spanish moss <br>
and sumacs
