The lightning bugs left months ago <br>
Your gossamer wake taking them out on <br>
Straw rafts

The birds are quiet <br>
But they are there <br>
Softly existing next to you <br>
Softly existing <br>
Next to me

Gray dusks <br>
Tallied in your head <br>
Running off the space on the page <br>
Remember the murky Susquehanna <br>
Sliding under your childhood <br>
Burning <br>
Bridges with the handshakes and smiles <br>
And plastic bags full of <br>
Things

Those are so long gone now <br>
Where did they go

Exist here softly next to <br>
Me <br>
In a quiet heat <br>
It’s okay if you <br>
Smother me <br>
You’re a mother sun <br>
Shining deep into plexiglass aviaries

Change with me <br>
Share my cocoon <br>
Surely I’ve left enough <br>
Space <br>
For a season <br>
Or two

My mind is a dandelion seed cloud <br>
In the spring wind

Hm, what’s that? <br>
What are you talking about? <br>
Forget that <br>
Let’s spread our limbs like routes <br>
And go
