pink pale morning

haven't seen the sun blush in seasons <br>
passing like childhood

only a rumor or a dream <br>
they used to tell us <br>
we would have

we dream alone now <br>
as we always have <br>
all in our head

i don't want to dream <br>
until i'm dead

just breathing out slow vapors <br>
into the winter night

~~~\* <br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~\* <br>
~~~~~~\*

dragon's breath <br>
we used to make believe <br>
we used to think we were <br>
in a fantasy

we used to play pretend <br>
and some of us never stopped

we dreamed of a man in the moon <br>
and the forgiveness of god <br>
and we forgot how to wake up

we used to play in paradise <br>
of innocent thoughts and <br>
pink pale minds <br>
our feet running miles in a moment <br>
somewhere far off we could only <br>
imagine

nobody there to count our footsteps <br>
only the smile of every beautiful thing <br>
looking back into our shouting glee

mouths wide open in joy

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\* <br>
~~~~~~~~~\* <br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\*

life puts a muzzle on people like us

breathing smoke into sharp crystal shadows

and the leaves are all fleeing <br>
skeleton trees <br>
left behind like grave markers

and i sometimes ask myself <br>
should we keep dreaming

of pink pale mornings <br>
and fantasy skies

should we keep dreaming

until we die

~~~\* <br>
~~~~~~~~~~~\* <br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\*

light falling on so many flowers <br>
in a field of stars

the sun poking fun at our faces <br>
and we smile back with warmth

in our eyes there is love <br>
you cannot comprehend its meaning

a steady moving rhythm <br>
cool rolling breeze

you pull at my sleeve for attention

we are not alone in this place

bright and fresh and fragile

like a string of petals

pale and pink and alive

awake
