Sun pulling tree needle sheets over <br>
A tired head <br>
For sleep

The lazy string lights dark and unpowered <br>
Before a wall of flitting birds and bugs <br>
Soft velvet noises emanating <br>
Their beaks and <br>
Mandibles <br>
Buzzing with words I want <br>
To understand

My fingers striking the keyboard <br>
Like driftwood over an ocean of endless <br>
Frustration <br>
Repeatedly giving way <br>
To progress

Tiny motes of light speeding by <br>
Circuits and locks and latches <br>
Flipping and spinning and burning <br>
So many thousand universes of stars and other <br>
Flickering fires under my fingers

And so small the sounds they make <br>
Against any noise <br>
At all

The tinny echoes dropping <br>
Into the canyons of self <br>
I am carving <br>
In books and certain soaking pages

====

If a tree falls in the forest, <br>
But nobody is around to hear it, <br>
Does it make a sound?
