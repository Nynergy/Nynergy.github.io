The air carries fractals searching in rifts
Splitting trees and sewing them back together
Running along the foam around rocks
Lining the creek bed
Butting up against the metal of this space
Between
The clocks and the windows and the hilltops and the highways

Empty hulls
Maritime doors rusted shut
Lakes pooling beneath their cliff side profiles
Monuments and lithographs climbing while
The open signs blink and twirl like the
Flakes outside the bay windows

Stuck in the thickening leaves
Where the ice has brought us together
Smiling for each other
But not with

What’s so wrong with that?
What do I look like to you?

Everyone is turning into the same lots
Off the highway
A giant funeral motorcade

—

There will be eyes pouring rain on them
All the toothpick trees mending wood bridges
Subsumed in water and lily pads
The lakeside paths they will circle
In their Gore-Tex boots

Under a canopy of breathing conifers and rain charms
Neighborhoods of campers and RVs
People passing the amber time in gray lives looking out
Growing moss on their wheels
Smiling at fish that pass by

And up at the peak of a Tuscarora forest
Sitting on a bench looking out
Over arid summer stones and lichens
Trees like ladders that just
End suddenly
And power lines tracing the path of towers back to a place
Of walls and ceilings

Looking down at the water becoming another sky
Just another planet
Rotating slowly

And the night comes
And the rain comes
And the eyes never blink
