The air carries fractals searching in rifts <br>
Splitting trees and sewing them back together <br>
Running along the foam around rocks <br>
Lining the creek bed <br>
Butting up against the metal of this space <br>
Between <br>
The clocks and the windows and the hilltops and the highways

Empty hulls <br>
Maritime doors rusted shut <br>
Lakes pooling beneath their cliff side profiles <br>
Monuments and lithographs climbing while <br>
The open signs blink and twirl like the <br>
Flakes outside the bay windows

Stuck in the thickening leaves <br>
Where the ice has brought us together <br>
Smiling for each other <br>
But not with

What’s so wrong with that? <br>
What do I look like to you?

Everyone is turning into the same lots <br>
Off the highway <br>
A giant funeral motorcade

—

There will be eyes pouring rain on them <br>
All the toothpick trees mending wood bridges <br>
Subsumed in water and lily pads <br>
The lakeside paths they will circle <br>
In their Gore-Tex boots

Under a canopy of breathing conifers and rain charms <br>
Neighborhoods of campers and RVs <br>
People passing the amber time in gray lives looking out <br>
Growing moss on their wheels <br>
Smiling at fish that pass by

And up at the peak of a Tuscarora forest <br>
Sitting on a bench looking out <br>
Over arid summer stones and lichens <br>
Trees like ladders that just <br>
End suddenly <br>
And power lines tracing the path of towers back to a place <br>
Of walls and ceilings

Looking down at the water becoming another sky <br>
Just another planet <br>
Rotating slowly

And the night comes <br>
And the rain comes <br>
And the eyes never blink
