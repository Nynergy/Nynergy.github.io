on rails in station <br>
stuck to paper headers feathers <br>
and tar <br>
like stationary <br>
business mandate <br>
compulsory

repulsive <br>
our gazes <br>
locked to one shadow <br>
burning sharp and bright <br>
as taillights <br>
at night

short meditations <br>
on wants needs and cravings <br>
like rainlings <br>
little fingers <br>
tracing <br>
the paths of drops <br>
coming down from <br>
the clouds

in glass and <br>
steady sand coming <br>
down from the <br>
clouds of <br>
time

we meditate <br>
and mediate <br>
between hate <br>
and the absence of <br>
self

back and forth <br>
rhythm <br>
take me <br>
through the end <br>
of this <br>
burning <br>
shadow
