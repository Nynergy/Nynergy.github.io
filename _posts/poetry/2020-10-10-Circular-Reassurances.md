going round in circles <br>
phantom smiling ghosts chase us <br>
going round our heads <br>
like comets

in our attempts to comprehend <br>
time <br>
it slips by <br>
in the curved space <br>
around your gravity arms <br>
those forms without force <br>
or speed

chasing comet trails <br>
what else are we here to do?

going round in circles <br>
tree rings chanting from within <br>
bark shawls <br>
crawling with small insects <br>
lost and getting <br>
cold

cold sheets we sweat in and under <br>
like bridges <br>
and other armatures of suspension <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of&nbsp;disbelief

going round in circles <br>
like the same dream you've had <br>
for so many years now <br>
reaching out for that <br>
brass ring

my ring's losing most of its finish <br>
slowly turning silver <br>
a snowy silver howling round my finger <br>
hollow winds of time <br>
gliding by

all the trees brittle <br>
all the grass splitting apart <br>
all the world in a bronze stupor <br>
before a white frigid heart

%%%

warm core glowing <br>
out frosted glass <br>
faces <br>
in watery windows <br>
or gazing from <br>
odd verandas

eyes flaming <br>
where do they find that blaze?

those spirits and phantoms who <br>
grasped at things I dream of <br>
and did not come away <br>
empty handed

%%%

going round in circles <br>
stars swinging in the whim <br>
like censers

their wills shining down <br>
on the fraying leaves <br>
on my fraying sleeves <br>
they gleam

and it's gone from me <br>
my hands are empty <br>
they're burned out <br>
they're burned clean

i've nothing left to say <br>
sometimes

%%%

summer morning after dawn <br>
when the tree still clung <br>
to dew like gems

hidden noises behind the house <br>
playing birds and deer and <br>
the children we once were

spring breathing gold <br>
down our necks like we'd <br>
bathed with the gods

and in our innocence we <br>
picked flowers <br>
for our mother
