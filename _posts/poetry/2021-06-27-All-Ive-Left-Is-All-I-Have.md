I statue-ize myself <br>
In a hand-me-down office chair <br>
In the place where I sleep <br>
In the place where I tumble sleepless <br>
In the place where I leap <br>
Crumbling mirage platforms <br>
To and fro and to again

I recognize myself <br>
In the mirror dripping glass <br>
Of summer through the window <br>
Screen to backyard hill rise <br>
Over humid wave melt horizon

The trees all stood still in the <br>
Sun-slaked air

I memorize myself <br>
Schematic reams and stacks <br>
Tipping toppled over <br>
June bug flutter heat splash <br>
And ripping torn asunder <br>
All the fragments <br>
Drift

And all I’ve left <br>
Of myself <br>
All I’ve left

Is all I have <br>
Is all I had

In blacktop simmer ripple pools <br>
Popped like bubbles <br>
I still myself and <br>
Return
