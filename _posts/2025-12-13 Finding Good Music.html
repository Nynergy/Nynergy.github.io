The era of music streaming has steadily hurt the industry and swindled artists,
all while masquerading as the "savior" of independent musicians and musical
discoverability. Many people, myself included, feel that the endless fields of
mood-based playlists and algorithm-curated mixes do not satisfy their hunger
for the music they crave.
</p>

<p>
In this age of mass-produced musical deluge, it can be difficult to know what's
actually worth listening to, and where to go to find it. Let's talk about a few
places to look, and a few strategies to employ when looking for new music.

    This is by no means an exhaustive list of resources for finding music. This
    is just how I tend to go about it, as someone who prefers albums over
    singles, and is always interested in expanding my musical horizons.

<h3>Traditional Tastemakers</h3>

<p>
Music critics have been around since there was music to criticize. While I
don't recommend using critics as your only source of musical intake, I do think
they can serve you well in providing outside opinions and perspectives on the
music industry, the current musical zeitgeist, and much more. Besides, it can
be fun to just listen to someone rant and rave about something they're very
passionate about.
</p>

<p>
If you spend any amount of time in the music-sphere of the Internet, I'm sure
you've heard the name "Anthony Fantano" mentioned. The Internet's Busiest Music
Nerd certainly lives up to that title as the man behind
<a {EXT_LINK} href="https://www.youtube.com/@theneedledrop">The Needle Drop</a>.
I have found countless albums through Anthony's reviews, including a few of my
Album of the Year's, but that doesn't mean I always agree with him.

<input id="2025-12-13-fn-2" type="checkbox"></input>
<small>
    That's kind of the thing about critics -- you don't need to agree with
    them. In fact, I find that using critics I don't entirely share a musical
    taste with is beneficial to expanding my own tastes.

</p>

<p>
Beyond the big names like Fantano, there are plenty of other critics and music
reviewers you can check out. Go find ones that speak to your needs as a music
listener.
</p>

<p>
For myself, the main sources I go to in terms of music opinions are Fantano,
Oliver of <a {EXT_LINK} href="https://www.youtube.com/@deepcuts">Deep Cuts</a>,
and Kelsie of
<a {EXT_LINK} href="https://www.youtube.com/@theyelllowbutton">The Yellow Button</a>.
</p>

<h3>Music Publications</h3>

<p>
One thing the Internet <em>has</em> actually made easier is getting access to
digital publications about music. From big names like
<a {EXT_LINK} href="https://pitchfork.com/">Pitchfork</a>, to the tons of
smaller sites and zines, there is no shortage of places to find music news,
reviews, opinions, interviews, etc.
</p>

<p>
I used to be an avid Pitchfork reader, though it's been quite some time since
I've found myself on the site. These days I tend to prefer the style and output
of <a {EXT_LINK} href="https://daily.bandcamp.com">Bandcamp Daily</a>.
Different publications will cater to different fans, so don't be afraid to go
looking around for one or a few that speak to your tastes.
</p>

<h3>Follow Breadcrumbs</h3>

<p>
If you find an interview of an artist you like, read it. Perhaps they'll talk
about the inspirations behind some of their music. Perhaps they'll talk about
what they've been listening to recently.
</p>

<p>
Maybe the artist has a Bandcamp page, and they've selected some other projects
to recommend to people on their page. Maybe people on
<a {EXT_LINK} href="https://rateyourmusic.com/">RYM</a> won't shut up about how
your favorite band is derivative of their favorite band.
</p>

<p>
If you find a thread of inspiration woven into music you like, then follow that
thread. You may just find a whole new artist to love, and learn a bit about the
history of their sound in the process.
</p>

<p>
Perpendicular to this "horizontal" approach to following breadcrumb trails is a
more "vertical" one. Rather than hopping from artist to artist, stick with the
same artist. Like one album in a band's discography? Listen to another one.
Odds are, if you like one, you'll like more.
</p>

<h3>Other</h3>

<p>
Word of mouth is a powerful thing. I discovered
<a {EXT_LINK} href="https://joannanewsom.bandcamp.com/album/ys">
    my favorite album of all time
</a> because someone I knew mentioned they had recently listened to it and
enjoyed it. Don't be afraid to follow seemingly-random paths into areas of
music you've never visited before. You may just like what you find.
</p>

<p>
And finally, as much as I bemoan the constant presence of feeds generated by
algorithms, they do sometimes still provide those diamonds in the rough we like
to look for. Most recently my YouTube algorithm managed to serve me the
absolute gem that is the new
<a {EXT_LINK} href="https://lacobservation.bandcamp.com/album/a-city-of-gandharvas">
    Lac Observation record
</a>, which I never would have found otherwise.
</p>

<p>
If you take a single thing from this blog post, let it be this: You are what
you eat, and that includes what you listen to. Don't let yourself become a
sanitized, corporate-funded, vibes-based mood board slop trough of sound. Find
the sound that liberates you from the dim future of commercial music. You have
nothing to lose but your chains.
