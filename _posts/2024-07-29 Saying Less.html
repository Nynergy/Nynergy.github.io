When I was very young, I didn't know how to shut up.
</p>

<p>
People would constantly have to tell me to stop talking, and eventually I
learned my lesson. I started talking less, and decided to expend that boundless
energy on creative pursuits. I would hole myself up in my room and invent
games, write stories and poetry, draw pictures, explore an endless tide of
interests.
<p>

<p>
Most of those interests have faded into the background, or disappeared
entirely.  But I do find myself in my mid-twenties still clutching to those
primal creative desires to make music, write poetry and prose, and create
something interesting and worthwhile. However, recently those desires have not
seemed so primal, so urgent.
</p>

<p>
It used to be that I couldn't help myself from spewing all manner of words into
thousands of poems, or composing every melody that got stuck in my head into a
song. I would release hours of music a year, or self-publish a collection of
poetry at the same steady pace; now it's been months since I've shown any signs
of life on my
<a {EXT_LINK} href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnWTmsuxOUfJYNEDGMFWmaw">Youtube channel</a>,
or written a poem any longer than a
<a {EXT_LINK} href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanka">Tanka</a>. Past
attempts at writing blog posts with any consistent schedule have all inevitably
failed.
</p>

<p>
I alluded to this feeling of silence, or stagnation, in the foreword to my last
poetry collection,
<a href="static/writing/Even If I Am Ash.pdf">"Even If I Am Ash"</a>,
as it was released nearly three whole years after the previous collection. I
don't like the feeling of being in this perpetual dry creative season. I find
it difficult to scrounge up the motivation to write more than a few lines of
poetry at a time, as I feel I simply have less to say without repeating myself.
I find it difficult to sit at my desk and make music without struggling to land
on a worthwhile idea or sound.
</p>

<p>
This second case is especially frustrating for me right now, as I'm coming up
on a self-imposed deadline to release the next
<a {EXT_LINK} href="https://mapsoflowfidelity.bandcamp.com/">Maps of Low Fidelity</a>
album by the end of September. As of the time of writing this blog post, I only
have an early version of a single track recorded, and it's the first recorded
music I've made in months.
</p>

<p>
I think part of this problem is the strange sense of dread it creates in me,
that I'm slowly drying up creatively, and will soon cease to create anything
else worth seeing the light of day.
</p>

<p>
But I also think this line of reasoning is a bit dramatic, and could use some
perspective from the world of reality. I've got more going on in my life now
than I ever have in the past, I've got a better grasp of what is worth sharing
and what is worth leaving on the cutting room floor, and I've been enjoying the
peace of mind that comes with simple -- and wordless -- appreciation of the
world around me.
</p>

<p>
These things forge a creative silence in my life, but what fills that silence
is not death, or anything so dramatic. It's life, all that other stuff that
goes on outside of my music and poetry. I have a job to do, bills to pay,
relationships to tend to, and life skills to acquire and hone.
</p>

<p>
So here are some ideas I'd like to implement going forward that will hopefully
help my mindset when it comes to my creative ventures:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Quality &gt; Quantity.</li>
    <li>
        Deadlines force creative approaches to solving blockages. Use them to
        your advantage, not to your mental detriment.
    </li>
    <li>
        Comparison will only destroy motivation. If what you create is true to
        yourself and resonates with your current situation, then it is good. It
        is enough.
    </li>
    <li>
        If the process is no longer enjoyable, then change the process. If no
        process is enjoyable, then perhaps you should think about whether you
        actually like what you are doing, and whether it is worth your
        time/effort.
    </li>
    <li>
        Not everything should be intended for other eyes/ears. Some things are
        just for you, and that's okay. If you go into every fresh idea with the
        thought that other people will be making judgements against it, then
        you will never be free enough to create what you want to create.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
These are things I want to keep in mind for the future, so that hopefully I can
create more things that people will resonate with and enjoy. I want to get back
into the habit of having fun making music and poetry. I want to write more blog
posts about random interests when the thought arises. I want to feel that same
primal creative desire I did when I was 10, and 20, and I want to feel it still
when I am 30 and beyond.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps you can apply some of these thoughts to make something you find
compelling as well. Thanks for reading.
