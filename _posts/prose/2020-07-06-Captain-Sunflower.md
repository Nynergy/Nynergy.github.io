A story drawn together from various fever dreams and inept attempts at writing compelling drama. This is what I've spent the past month or so writing, and I'm quite proud of it, but there's definitely some more work that needs to be done to refine it.

And of course it features more overt references to my musical tastes. I hope you find it a worthwhile read. Thank you.

Friday night with Juno. Quincy and Porter in the corner playing pool. Sinking pockets fencing cues tossing words like a game of catch. Friendly mouths back and forth. Keith and Carter argue over Nintendo controllers. Tube glowing high scores. Two, three wall mounted clocks. All different angles, different time streams. Outside swaying night. Drunken windows sober curtains. Juno curling a finger in the booth.

“Took ya long enough to show, Jay. Get cold feet or somethin’?”

Her grin peeks between trees. Forest of bangs, black and pink leaves. Volley a grin in return.

“Nah, just took a while deciding which Lambo to take, y’know?”

Juno’s laugh a cutting force. Slash and burn fields of gloom. Rays of fire poking through. Adjusting her choker. Another sip from her glass, push aside the little umbrella.

“You tryin’a impress me, Jay? Don’t think I’ve forgotten about that time you crashed your bike tryin’a get some girl’s attention.”

Hands up in defense.

“Oh c’mon, that was years ago! We all did stupid shit back in high school.”

“Jay, that happened two months ago.”

“...well shit, you got me there.”

Sheepish slump down the other side of the booth. Basement echoes as Keith pulls out a win. Porter sinks a double. Juno slides a full glass forward, no umbrella.

“Drink up, lover boy.”

Small sips. Sour lemons. Something in her waiting voice.

“I told you not to call me that.”

“You told me a lot of things that didn’t matter.”

Poison barbs. Stinging nettles. Her lashes grow like jellyfish tendrils.

“Look, that’s in the past. We don’t have to bring it up. And I’m sure you invited me to do more than berate me.”

The sly grin familiar. She retreats. Retracts the claws. Adjusts the choker.

“Have it your way, Jay. The night is young.”

The crack of a cue ball against the break. Ricochet around in metaphors. Juno’s eyes tell no stories. Magic 8 balls blank.

Idle time talking floating away. Clock hands rolling over themselves. Drunken rain falling outside. Quincy and Carter tossing darts. Keith passed out on the couch. Porter meanders like a cat to the booth. Spotting prey.

“Jay, long time no see. How’s it hanging?”

Deposits himself leather jacket and all next to Juno. Arm around shoulders. Cheshire grin.

“Oh, you know. Hangin’ in there.”

"That's good! Glad to hear it..."

Turning to Juno, her head swaying away from the gaze.

"It's gettin' pretty late, babe, what say we head back to my place for the night, eh?"

Her face approaches the color of her highlights. Eyes still dark as the rest.

"It's still pretty early, I mean, I'm in the middle of catchin' up with Jay an' all..."

Hands up in defense.

"Alright, alright. You know I gotta pick up a shift tomorrow, though, so I gotta head out soon. I'll wait in the car for ya if you decide you want to split with me in the next few minutes."

He stands and heads for the stairs opposite the booth, never looking back at Juno. He carries his expectations in the open. Keith snores on the other side of the room. Carter and Quincy keep tossing and tallying points, pausing to laugh where appropriate. Muffled white noise of rain filling in the gaps between.

"Hey, are you doing okay, Juno? Like, with... _him_?"

Juno quickly grabs her drink, glancing to the side.

"Yeah, of course. What are you on about, Jay?"

The glass has nothing but ice left. She keeps her lips sealed around the straw.

"Don't lie to me. I know you better than that. You couldn't look him in the eye, and you were never one to be embarrassed. Is everything alright between you two?"

A pause punctuated with a sigh.

"Yes, everything's fine. We're just, uh... in a bit of, uh... a 'rough patch', or whatever you wanna call it."

She returns to sipping at the empty glass. Her dark eyes move to check if her message was received, quickly flitting back to an interesting spot on the wall. No sense pushing against an immovable object.

"Alright, I'll take your word for it. But don't hesitate to call me if something's up."

"Since when do you suddenly care about me like that again?"

Stinging force. A blind jellyfish. Instincts and eyeliner. A faint buzz. Juno looks at her phone.

"I've gotta go. He's waitin' for me outside."

She gets up and heads for the stairs. One foot on a step, her eyes closed. Listening to something. Her own thoughts. The rain still coming down.

"Wait, Juno."

Dark eyes snap to attention.

"Don't forget your umbrella. It's pouring out there."

In between Jay's fingers is a little drink umbrella. Big smile, obviously proud of his joke. Juno keeps ascending, eyes closed again.

From the dartboard, "Don't worry Jay, I thought it was pretty funny."

"...Thanks, Quince."

Time continues moving. Clocks turning over. Carter and Quincy head out. Someone put a blanket on Keith. The rain lets up for a moment. A brief smoke in the quiet night. Steam rising from the pavement. Hot and sticky, humid fingers. Cars passing like ships in the pitch black.

Something like a salty breeze passes over. Feelings of a vessel swaying. Waves coming up, going down. Shaky legs, stood on the bow. White clouds broad daylight sailing away. Whales breaching across the tide. Long seasons passing.

Gone in a puff of smoke. Vaporous thoughts of Juno. Memories scratching an itch. Sharp angular features. Pulling on her choker. Intersections of her gaze. Drawing him in.

Ocean melody playing with his ears. Siren on the outcropping. Ship's wheel spinning. More clouds rolling in. Crespuscular rays coming down. Waters parting churning shifting. Her face beaming. Blinding. Singing. In her arms. Stinging. Dreaming. A light sinking down like the Sun. The rain comes again.

Cigarette butt smoking on the asphalt. Just a small break. The rain gains momentum.

Jay heads home.

<hr>

Days pass. Calm waters. Bright skies. A message in a bottle arrives. Juno's recorded voice twisting riddles like treasure maps.

"Hey, Jay. I'm, uh, I'm just calling to let you know I'm free today, and if you wanted to, like, hang out or something, uh... Listen, it's been a while since... and... okay, look, don't get the wrong idea. I'm hella bored and Porter is working until 10 tonight, so just, let's go do something."

She stops talking, but the voicemail still shows more time.

"...You can just ignore this message if you want. I'm not tryin'a give you the wrong idea or anything, I mean... God, what am I doing..."

_Click_

Something strange in the gut. A moment's thought. Keys, spare helmet, thinning wallet. Trying to conjure ideas through a mist of doubt. Indecision. The ride is short and quiet, an empty mind still loud. Apartment tower. Buzzed in, elevator up. Door opens into empty pizza boxes, takeout containers. A monsoon of clutter scattered like a tantrum. Juno wears sweatpants and long sleeves. Choker still wrapping her neck.

"Christ, Juno, I knew you weren't exactly a neat freak, but this is something else. It looks like a tornado ripped this place a new one. Honestly, I'm more surprised that Porter puts up with this mess."

Quiet and deadpan, "He's actually the reason it looks like this. I'm just too lazy to clean it up."

"Damn, I never woulda thought. Well anyway, we're going out like you wanted. Get changed and take this."

Juno juggles the tossed helmet before catching it. She examines it for a moment, then Jay's face. Dialogue in expressions exchanged for a brief moment. Juno takes the helmet into her bedroom, Jay waiting watching pidgeons flock about outside the window. She exits wearing black pants and a pink hoodie.

"It's a little hot for something like that, isn't it?"

"I'll be fine, don't worry about me."

She holds her helmet under her arm and walks out the door, not waiting for a response. Jay follows like a ghost as she takes the stairs down.

Blue light through the windows shifting. Flowing. Her hair caught in a watery dance. Descending pressure mounting. Something caught in the mouth, caught on the tongue, in the teeth. Diving bell reverberations. Pink coral of her hair. The lobby door opens. All the water drains, sweeping away.

They get on the bike, don helmets, Juno's arms around Jay's midsection.

"So where are we goin'?"

"Hell if I know."

A saccharine chuckle. A slight squeeze.

"I was hoping you'd say that."

<hr>

Racing toward the sunset. Coastline highway. Wind in sails. Stopped on the shoulder, smoke wafting up. Juno holds her cigarette in her mouth as it dangles over the cheap lighter in Jay's hand. Leaning on the guardrail. No cars. Two solitary creatures.

"I want you to be honest with me. Are you doing okay?"

Looking out at the ocean, left arm across her body holding her right.

"...Yeah, I'm fine. I keep telling you, you don't have to worry about me anymore."

"I know. But you know I'm not like that. You know I worry about you. I still care about you."

"Jay, can you quit it with that bullshit? We're not together anymore. You don't have to treat me like some clumsy kid. I'm an adult, and so are you. Neither of us are those same dumb kids we were before."

Those stinging nettles. Running water cutting through canyons. Clarity, no hesitance.

"...I suppose you're right."

A slight breeze. Smoke passing over the face at the bow of the ship. Sun coming down behind flowing hair. A scowl aimed at the horizon.

"Porter isn't exactly what I've been looking for. But he's sweet. He treats me like a woman, not a girl. He knows what I like. And I know what he likes. Loving him is simple."

A deadpan glance, still grabbing her arm.

"Loving him is easy in a way it never was with you, Jay."

"...I see."

A puff of smoke before his eyes.

"...Are you certain this is what you want? If you're serious about him, I'll let it be. But you seem unsure."

Facing Juno and the crimson sun behind her.

"Are you really happy, Juno?"

".............."

".............."

"...I think so."

".........Okay."

Cigarettes snuffed underfoot. Twilight takes them home. Under dim streetlights. Arms still squeezing. Park and dismount. Juno hands back the spare helmet.

"Thanks for takin' me out today. I really had a good time. Reminded me of our early college days."

"Me too. Don't be afraid to call me again."

Unspoken words in dark eyes. Juno enters the lobby. Jay drives off.

Spinning torpedo blades behind. Twisting force. Torque of inner spirals. Nautilus shell bones. Slicing through the deep blue. Anglerfish lights suspended overhead. Deep blue to black with questions. Stinging stabbing words loose ends left out on the sand. In the smoke spreading into the atmosphere. Back in the creaking echoes of a ship. Bed swaying on pendulum waves. Head full of empty bottles. All the words wiped away in the tide. Just dark eyes at the bottom. Swallowing pits.

The eyes take him as he sleeps.

<hr>

Jay dreams of a memory. Something fragile, in a chest in a corner of his mind.

Back in Keith's basement. College summer afternoon. Gathered at the couch, controllers passed around. Super Smash Bros Melee. Idle talking over furious button mashing.

"So, where's Carter again?"

"I think he had some kind of funeral. A relative or something."

"Ah, right. Damn, that sucks."

"Quince, how are you so good at this? I thought you hadn't played since we graduated."

"Muscle memory, man. I'm a machine..."

"Juno, you want something to drink? I'm gonna grab something from the fridge upstairs."

Grabbing Jay's sleeve, "I'll follow you up there."

The two ascend the wooden stairs into the kitchen. Slush of amber light through windows. Jay's head in the fridge.

"Know what you want? Looks like he's got Coke, orange soda, couple'a beers. I'm sure he won't mind if we cop a couple'a Blue Moons."

No answer.

Sticking his head out above the door, "Hello? Juno?"

One arm crossed over her chest holding the other. Free hand playing with her choker. Dark eyes cast on linoleum. Long black hair shrouding her expression. Jay lets the fridge door swing closed.

"Hey, are you all right? Is there something going on?"

Slowly, with trepidation, "...My dad is dead."

"...Well that's quite the news to suddenly drop on me. I'm sorry. But didn't your dad leave when you were, like, five or something?"

"Yeah, I... I never really knew him."

The fridge opens back up.

"Yeah, so it isn't that big a deal, really. I mean, I'm not glad he's dead, but it's not like he had much sway over your life in the first place. So tell me, what are you looking to drink?"

Still no response. Another peek over the door.

Golden light playing with something wet on Juno's cheek.

"What... what do I do? How am I supposed to feel? I thought I was supposed to... hate him. But I don't."

Jay closes the door again and stands face to face with Juno.

In a light tone, "Juno, it doesn't matter how you feel. He's just another guy to you. It's like my mom, after the divorce she never wanted to see me again. Remarried and moved across the globe. As far as I'm concerned, this is the same deal."

"It doesn't... matter? How I feel?"

"Juno, you know I didn't mean it like that-"

"Shut up. I told you about this because I'm scared. Like I should hate him, but I don't. Like I wish I knew him better."

Crystal points plummet from her jaw. Window lights turning dark and blue, watery.

Struggling through oncoming sobs, "And now he's gone. He's fucking dead, and I'll never get to see him. And I'm going through hell in my head over this, and I thought you would have something nice to say, something supportive. Something to make this mess clearer."

"Juno, I-"

"But NO, instead you put up this tough guy act and tell me I'm WRONG. That my feelings DON'T MATTER."

"Don't yell, the guys will hea-"

"THIS ISN'T ABOUT THEM."

Silence. The room darkens further. Long black hair floating. Tears rippling out like bubbles.

"...You couldn't even just shut up and give me a hug..."

Sobbing in earnest. Choker ripped off, clutched in one hand. Midnight blue light pouring in through portholes. Everything lifting up in water. Rising up to the ceiling taking off into a black sky. Rays of stark white streaming over Juno's body, caught in a dead man's float. Going up, and up, and up. Jay reaches out, floating away. Her liquid hair suddenly chopped shoulder-length. Pink highlights. Mermaid tail. Jay drifting down into a linoleum crevice. Bubbles rushing up. Bubbles in the lungs.

The memory dissolves.

<hr>

More fairweather days roll by. More boring shifts at the marina. Slow security detail hours flooded with phantom feelings of that dream. All the expensive yachts and meager fishing vessels bobbing in agreeance with the tide. Some nothing more than an oversized rowboat. With the gold dripping off the Sun resting along the angular forms and waxy finishes. Seafoam noise. Cool rolling rhythm. Gulls swirling over the docks. Sat in the shade. Folding chair next to a small Bluetooth speaker. Pat Metheny Group carrying a small breeze along. Jay gazes out the door of the security station.

Distant turning of boardwalk attractions. Faint peals of laughter and jubilant screaming. A group of middle-aged men pack fishing supplies into an unassuming boat, _The Halcyon_ written along the port side in a striking yellow slanted script. Another man and his young daughter come greet them. She wears a floppy-looking sunhat far too large for her head, nearly as wide as the grin across her face. Uncountable sails dotting the still waters, a rainbow collection. Freight ships lumbering along the horizon.

On the bridge of a cargo vessel. Hands on the wheel. All the dials and instruments spinning chirping blinking happily. Secrets in giant metal containers lining the deck. Strapped down. Clouds rolling in. A hand grabbing the wheel. Pink hoodie sleeve, cigarette smoke filling the cabin. Rain coming down on the glass, over the rusting containers. Unable to move. Yanking the wheel, the ship pitches. Against the wall, eyes covered in a forest of black and pink leaves. Consoles coming loose, water pooling. Capsizing.

"Excuse me, sir?"

A stern voice back in reality. A woman peering in the door, worried expression.

"Oh! Uh, yeah, can I help you?"

"My daughter just fell, she's just a little scraped up, but we could use a bandage."

She moves aside, pointing to the sunhat girl across the docks. Sobbing, holding her knee, her father crouched down with consoling words.

"We would use the first aid kit on the boat, but we can't seem to find it. Do you have one on hand?"

"Yeah, absolutely. Lemme bring it out there for ya."

Jay hauls out a scuffed up white box with a plastic handle, walks it out to the dock where _The Halcyon_ is moored. Girl still bawling, no open bleeding. Opening the case like a tackle box, Jay reaches for a generic Band-Aid, but stops short and opts instead for a box of decorative ones.

"Alright, Little Miss, let me see that knee of yours. I've got a special Band-Aid here just for you. And look, it's even got pretty sunflowers on it."

Waterworks turned down a few notches, the girl extends her leg. Just a bad scrape, covered in golden sunflowers. Her crying stops almost immediately. As Jay packs everything up, the mother comes over.

"Thank you so much."

"Ah, it's nothing. I'm just doing my job."

Back in the folding chair. Sails still crawling along the water. Golden light skittering across every peak.

Lightning skipping from window to window. Through looking glass bubbles. Everything flotsam and thrashing roil. Dark eyes through the brine. Salty smile, white pearl teeth. Grabbing the midsection, mooring lines anchors pulling. Stormlight receding under layers above.

Little ropes around Jay's legs. Looking down. Another visitor under a large sunhat.

"Well, hello again, Little Miss. Or should I call you Sunflower?"

Looking up under the wide brim. Pearlescent smile, missing a canine or two.

"You look mean, but you're not a meanie!"

"Uh... thanks? Do I really look mean?"

Still grinning, she nods her head furiously, the sunhat flopping about.

"But you're nice! I like you, Mister."

"Thanks. I like you, too, Sunflower. You're not too shy about how you feel."

The girl begins inspecting every inch of the security station, trying to decipher the labels of filing cabinets, cases, drawers, questioning Jay every so often.

"What's this?"

"That's a megaphone."

"Wooooaaaaahhh......... What's this?"

"That's where we keep a lot of paperwork."

"Oooohhh, paperwork.... What's this?"

This time pointing to the Bluetooth speaker. "On Her Way" coming through the cool breeze.

"Pat Metheny Group. Ever heard of 'em?"

"No. Is this some kinda adult music?"

With a chuckle, "Yeah, I guess you might call it that. It's relaxing."

The two go on exchanging questions and answers for a bit.

"So Sunflower, what are you doing here, anyway? Did you just want to explore my little office?"

Eyes ablaze, "We're going fishing today!"

"...Well that's not really... I mean, yeah, that sounds like fun."

"Yeah! Daddy's got a big boat! We're gonna be out on the water!"

Sunflower points out the door to the waters teeming with other vessels, the Sun still splashing light over everything.

"Sounds pretty cool."

"Yeah! I'm the caption of the Halcyon!"

Not only did she say "caption" instead of "captain", but she pronounced "Halcyon" with a hard "k" sound. Jay couldn't help but laugh.

"Hey. what's so funny, Mister? I'm serious! I'm the caption!"

Jay can't contain his laughter, holding his stomach as Sunflower grows more and more frustrated. An innocence scratching at his mind. A bold force moving through the tangle of cloudy doubts.

Dark eyes going white. The light seeping in through the cracks. Water boiling off in a sweat along the coast. Shipping containers with fresh coats of paint. A gossamer veil flapping like a sunhat over the lazy freighter.

A woman's voice coming in through the door.

"There you are! What are you doing up here, we're about to go!"

"Mommy, I'm the caption!"

The mother walks into the small shack, taking her daughter by the hand, pointedly ignoring her outburst.

"I'm so sorry she was bothering you."

Giving a big smile, "No, no, not at all. I enjoyed the company."

Jay looks the girl in the eyes under that wide floppy sunhat.

"Will ya bring back some cool fish for me?"

Another bout of furious nodding as her grin expands beyond the border of her face.

"Good." Looking up at the mother, "You guys stay safe out there, and enjoy the beautiful weather."

"Thank you. Have a great day."

The two exit the shack, Sunflower looking back with a heart-melting smile. _The Halcyon_ pushes off, and the group sets off into the golden light. Jay is left to himself in the shade of the small shack. Gulls still circling, boardwalk shouts still cutting through the sweeping breeze. The speaker pouring out the closing melodies of "Wherever You Go".

The day grows longer, and Jay regrets that he must head home before _The Halcyon_ and her captain return. His head is filled with thoughts of bright fish as he rides home.

Still waters. Cotton candy clouds. An ancient self filled with the spirit of adventure. Something stirring in the bones. Sun making room for the moon, the inumerable stars, blinking peacefully.

An image of Juno smiling through long black hair, or blushing at his confession freshman year.

Those halcyon days, making their way across his mind like a fishing boat on calm waters. Under golden rays of light.

<hr>

Some time later, another message in a bottle arrived. Shorter, more forceful.

"Hey, I know you don't work on Thursdays, so let's do something together. You know where to find me."

That voice stirring whirlpools. That voice smiling behind a dense black forest. That voice a surging glacier memory. Cracks of hurt coming loose, melted through. No hesitation out the door, on the road, parked in front of the complex. An oil rig under roiling gray clouds, looming blue tint.

A fragment of doubt, or the sunglow in her eyes. Double layer superpositioned ideas. Bubbles wrapping choker lines. Tumbling sheets in the pitch crude night.

Through the front doors, lobby pressurized portholes bolted shut. Bioluminescent lamps on the walls. Dark tiles to the elevator.

S'mores around bonfires. Head on a shoulder. Fever dream white light ascension. Growing a tail, for what? To swim away.

Hull doors sealed shut. Going up. Going up. Jay studies his feelings. Steadies intentions. Stories go by. Going up.

Little drink umbrellas. That turning look away. A grove of fuschia reeds, hiding between. Hiding within, that Cheshire grin.

Coming up for air. Doors slice apart depressurized. Longing intensifies, filling space in the bones. Feeling the bends, no control.

Juno standing outside the door to the apartment.

Jay stood freshly caught in the elevator cage.

"...I saw your bike from my window."

Nothing but a T-shirt and a thong. Her eyes promising oil slicks. Her arms showing bruises and marks.

She heads into the apartment and Jay follows silently. Door bolted locked, shades drawing shadows across the couch. TV humming some drama re-run. Juno sprawled out like temptation embodied. Jay moves in with a mind absent of consequence.

Slyly from the couch, "I thought I'd have to convince you to do something like this again."

With minimal expression, "I knew you wouldn't call me here just for another ride."

Her smirk a physical force, "Don't write that possibility off just yet..."

Blue-gray sky warms to red coming down across the clouds. Siren song clutching. Rushing in and over and back and out in tides. Cardboard flotsam joined by discarded clothing. Oil rig armature holding steady against the ebb and flow. Every direction and angle, pouring out of the overfull container. Dancing in slick rain without a care. For hours they swim through familiar waters.

Out of the shower, Juno pauses in the full length mirror. Jay behind her fixing his hair. Quiet and unsure, exchanging looks.

"Jay, don't, uh... Don't let this get to your head. This was a one time thing."

"Oh really?"

"...Yeah. I mean, people do this all the time, right?"

"Do what? Have sex behind their boyfriend's back? Sure, let's go with that."

"No, that's not... *sigh* ...You know that's not what I meant."

In a half-mocking tone, "Yeah, you're right. You meant that it's normal to keep living with someone who beats you."

Turning to face the still-naked man, "Jay! What the hell, what's wrong with you?!"

Matching her tone, "Don't think I didn't notice all those bruises. I'm sure that's what's going on. I've known Porter for a long time, I know the kind of temper he has. And all that mess out there? I highly doubt you guys are just _casually_ throwing things around."

Juno is silent. Grabbing one arm, turning back to the mirror. Looking down at the floor, bangs hanging over her eyes.

"...I, you're... You're wrong, he's not... he isn't like............that......."

Jay moves up behind Juno, holding her arm just above a faded bruise. She recoils, but softens after a moment. Leaning into him.

"Juno, you know what I'm gonna say about him."

After a moment's pause, "You know what? Maybe you're right. Maybe I should leave him. But..."

"But?"

"But, I don't know. Maybe I still love him. Maybe I still love you. No, I take that back. I don't really know how I feel about either of you. But I don't have anywhere else to go. He takes care of me here."

"You can come live with me-"

Turning around, her hand over his mouth, "Don't you dare. Don't start with that bullshit. Do you even see what you're doin' to me? Every time I see you it's like you're either my mom or my fuckbuddy. I'm not your little fix-up hobby, and I sure as hell ain't your personal sex toy. You're so wishy-washy it's fuckin' killing me, Jay. You're killing me."

She takes her hand away, but Jay has no response. He stands stunned in her bathroom.

"Then... what was all that we just did? I don't see you as some toy, Juno. I still love you. I think I've made that pretty obvious."

"...I don't know how to feel about what we just did. Maybe it was a mistake. But I think you have a lot to learn if you want to convince me of your 'undying love' for me."

Exaggerated air quotes around that phrase. More stinging nettles, poison barbs. An eternity passes. Clouds outside turning maroon to black.

"...I guess I'll get outta your hair, then."

Jay gets dressed and shuffles through the strewn take out containers to the door. TV drone bouncing back off the shades still drawn, metallic echoes in a deep sea chamber. Ancient submarine settled at the bottom of the sea. Juno still comes to see him off. Stood face to face in the entranceway.

"Hey, I'm sorry for going off on you like that. I just need you to know how I feel. You're so self-absorbed with your own feelings, I don't want you to forget about mine."

Somewhat defeated, "I know. I don't blame you. I still care about you, I really do. A hell of a lot more than he does."

That last one hangs in the air for a solid moment.

"I'll be fine. Don't worry about me. If I need anything, I'll call you."

Siren's clutch around the midsection. Some warm slick slipping down Jay's mind. A choppy tide. A dripping rain. Her bruises encompass him. For a moment.

And then he leaves. Door shut behind him.

<hr>

Rain spilling outside over the next few days. Coming home from each shift anxious for a voicemail. Another sandy, yellowed page asking for a companion. Head on the cool pillow, the warm humming of rain through the window. Mist rising off the pavement below. Eyes closed, images of ships and Ferris wheels along the piers. Fireworks over the bay, Juno's face ecstatic in awe. Beach towel watchers, her arm outstretched, pointing at shapes of light. A star. A cresent. A sailboat. A sunflower.

"Look, Mister! I'm a flyerwork!"

Sunflower sits excitedly pointing at the lights. She faces Jay with a galactic-sized grin.

"Who's that girl you were playin' with the other day, Mister?"

From an inner chamber, Jay's voice softly echoes around her sunhat, over the waves.

"Who? Oh, you mean Juno?"

"Yeah! She's pretty!"

"She is, isn't she?"

More forms exploding over the coast. A comet. A cross. A fish. A mermaid.

"Jay, do you think we're fucked up?"

Juno looks at Jay with a pained curiosity.

"What do you mean?"

"Like, what if we're broken? What if, because we had shitty parents, we don't know how to be normal people?"

A pause before the voice plays between the strands of pink hair on her head.

"What does that matter? Why bother worrying about it? We're people. Humans. No one is perfect."

A tree. A cat. A lightning bolt. A cloud.

"Do you like her, Mister?"

Invisible breath playing with grains of sand.

"...Yeah, I like her a lot."

"How do you know?"

"....well...uh..."

A house. A waterfall. A car. A great big smile.

"How do you know you love me, Jay?"

"...When I look at you, it comes to me. That feeling. I think of you all the time."

"...But what if it's wrong?"

The tide begins coming up. The moon comes a bit closer. A jester's hat. A bicycle. A soaring seagull. A twilight postcard.

"What does it feel like, to like someone?"

"Well, Sunflower, it's like a, uh... kind of a warm feeling... I guess..."

The water begins soaking into the beach towel. Cold salty smell. Osmosis chill. A lighthouse. A dog. A notebook. A many-ringed planet.

"What if I can't love, Jay? What if I'm too fucked in the head because my dad left me?"

An invisible hand reaching out. Visible recoil.

"Juno, you worry too much. Relax."

The beach is submerged. Up to the waist in water. Ashy remnants of smoke from fireworks falling like snow into the blackening ocean. Sunflower's smile lit up by the strobing explosions. A cliff. A trumpet. A volcano. A spaceship.

"So what were you doin' with that girl, Mister?"

"What? Oh, we were just, uh... just playin' around, y'know?"

"I saw mommy and daddy playing around once. You must really like her!"

Biting saltwater up to the neck. A plane. A portal. A quarter. A cigarette butt.

"Is that how you feel about my girlfriend, Jay?"

Porter stares at Jay with an inquisition gaze.

"No, no! I would never do something like that to you, Porter! We're just friends, that's all. Seriously."

Swallowing ash and foam, over the top of the head. Sinking down. A trench. A jackal. A cellphone. A black hole.

"Is that all I am to you, Jay?"

"I... I mean, no, or... We can be more than that, maybe, still..."

The flashing above the water line stops.

"Mister, do you love her?"

Sunflower floats in the dark swirl like a tethered mine. Her smile is gone.

"I......... I don't know."

"Then why did you fuck her?"

Jay's eyes snap open as the sound of thunder rattles his mind. Cold sweat, half the sheets on the floor. Heavy rain. He gets up and closes the window. Sitting on the bed. Still half-comatose, feeling the brine make its way down his throat. The acrid scent of fireworks fresh in his memory. A psychosomatic fever dream.

On the nightstand, his phone glows white hot. Another message in a bottle.

<hr>

"...Jay......Jay......You need, to..... I need......"

That voice thin and wavering as a ripple from a stone's throw. Caught in the throat between sobs, hiccups, and confusion.

".....He..... He found us out.... Jay....."

Following an ambulance down the highway, that voicemail playing endlessly in his helmetless head.

"....Jay, I.... I need you. I need you."

Rain whipping his face, a racing pinnace in the numb night. Strung out humming seconds bleeding away from the clouds. Pitch black between the building lights.

"Come and.... Come get me.......... I need you, Jay. I'm on the roof. He, he threw me out."

Up the elevator shaft. Hook and cable pulling. Top floor opening up staircases to the tempest. Oily world of undulating steam rising from below. Juno crumpled against an A/C unit. Her face a field of darkness. Bruises, mascara, swollen dark eyes. Looking at Jay like a deer in headlights. Clothes disheveled, her choker missing. Hair slick and matted from the rain.

Jay hurries to her, kneeling down to her eye level.

"Juno, what happened!? Why are you up here!?"

She lays her head on his shoulder and weeps without words.

"Juno, we should get inside. Can you move?"

Her head comes up. Most of her face is bruised or swollen. Bangs stuck at angles across her eyes.

"I.... I don't know..... I don't think so."

"What did that fucker do to you? And what are you doing up here?"

She takes long, shuddering breaths between sentences.

"....He, he... I don't know how he figured it out, Jay......I don't know... where else to go...... He threw all my shit out, and he.... he hit me... so many, times....... I... I, came up here..... to fucking jump."

No response.

"...I have nothing left. I fucked it all up. You were right."

Grabbing her tightly, "Juno, come live with me. Please."

".....I..... I can't. I can't love you."

"Juno, please. Look at you. Look what he did to you."

"Jay, please, stop."

"You don't have to love me! You can just crash at my place! Just, please, you can't live like this. I won't let you get hurt like this again."

"Jason."

Rain coming down. Steady.

"......I've got nothing left. I'm too fucked up."

"...Stop saying that..."

With a new bout of tears coming down, "Jay, why am I like this?"

Soaking the fabric of his shirt. Everything falling out of place. Juno's arms go slack as Jay holds her, head on his shoulder.

After a while, "This... This is what you wanted, wasn't it, Juno?"

Before she can answer, the door to the roof opens. Porter steps out into the steam, leather jacket and hood. Momentary surprise at the sight of Jay.

"So. Returned to the scene of the crime, huh?"

He moves toward the unit.

With an animalistic vitriol, "Porter, you motherfucker! I'm gonna beat the livin-"

A boot across Jay's mouth. World spinning away. Choppy water. No sea legs.

"Shut your mouth. I don't wanna hear anything from you. I thought we were friends, Jay."

Porter turns to Juno and smiles.

"And you, you goddamn whore. I called you five times. Not one answer."

He kneels down and grabs her face by the jaw, forcing her to look forward.

"And here I was thinking I might let you back in. What a shame. To think I missed that pretty face."

He tightens his grip. She spits in his face. Forward and back again, he brings her head into the metal plate of the A/C unit. A dull thud. The sound of rain drowing a yelp of pain.

"Looks like you still need to learn your lesson, ya little-"

Tackled to the side, Jay and Porter trade blows along the slick roof. Back and forth. Relentless waves crushing over and over. Jay's fist a crest falling on Porter's head. Sweeping leg like an undertow. Juno watches from a world away, in a daze of trauma. They jostle up to the edge of the roof. Jay pinned down, head hanging over the lip to the street far below. A fist pulled back like a snake coiling to strike.

"So this is what our friendship meant to you, huh Jay?" A solid blow across his jaw. "Just an opportunity to fuck my girl, huh?" Another strike like an icepick. "Couldn't help yourself, huh?" Jay can't speak. He sees Porter's face without thought. He feels the empty air beneath him. He takes another hook. "Well this is what you get, you hear me? YOU HEAR ME, YOU FUCKIN' PIG!?"

No response.

From the unit, "Porter....... stop......"

Jay slumps to the ground and Porter turns to Juno.

"You gonna defend him? Dream on. This fucker's dead."

"......Fuck you. I never loved you."

He kneels down to Jay, suddenly quieter. More sinister.

"...You hear that? She never loved me." A slight chuckle. "I wonder whose fault that is, now..."

He grabs Jay and hoists him up on top of the lip of the roof.

Exasperated, "Don't, Porter! Let him be!"

"He took everything from me. That was you, Juno. _Was_ you. And what does he have to say for himself?" He looks to Jay, but he gets no response. Jay's eyes are steady on Juno. Glassy. Empty. "Absolutely nothing."

Jay sits calmly on the lip. He hears the rain falling around his ears. He hears the cars moving below. He sees Juno leaning against the large metal unit. He sees her pink highlights. He sees her torn and soaked clothes. He sees her battered and bruised face. He sees his siren on the outcropping. He can't look away. He sees a small girl, crying over a scraped knee.

He feels a small pressure on his chest. Like a soft nudge. The sky is turning upside down. The steam tentacle-like wrapping his body. All the windows shining reflections of streetlights and cars. Sinking down into a trench. That mermaid tail swimming away into charcoal clouds, becoming bubbles in a striking white light. Slowly now. Gently coming down. A stone floating, never settling. All the lights like giant broods of jellyfish, every one giving him a warm hug. An endless field of luminous memories. Scintillating softly beyond his eyes. Closed now. He still sees them. Those shapes that are not shapes, those forms that are nothing more than a dream he once wished for.

<hr>

Up from the cabin he rises. Stepping foot on the deck. Salt on the wind. The velvet light of the morning. The disk of the Sun turning over in the sky. Flat line horizon. Red amber hue of clouds lazily moving along. Comforting sway of the vessel. There in the womb of the sea, skating along its surface. A golden silhouette between the masts, dancing among the sails. He moves toward it. The figure turns around, holding her sunhat to her head as the breeze threatens to strip it away. Her grin explodes before glowing gold hair.

They move over the water, and they laugh there together.
