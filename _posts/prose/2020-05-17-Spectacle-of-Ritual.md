Alex steps back a few paces from the canvas. She puts her hand on her chin, thinking intently about the piece’s progress. Her skin is smudged with a stroke of phthalo blue, though she doesn’t notice, or doesn’t care. The slanted squares of color climb the pure white sheet underneath in layers of geometric patterns. Shapes and conventional forms emerge from the composition. Windows on buildings in dragon scale alignments. Hanging baskets of flowers like pendulums from awnings, just a quick series of yellow and green strokes. Still a white space evading any color or form in the lower right corner.

Alex approaches the window of the studio that looks down at the street below, across the way from the flower shop. A cat meanders around the storefront, occasionally picking a spot to bathe in the failing sunlight. A woman exits the art gallery next door and eyes up the flower shop before checking her wallet and entering. With her fingers splayed in front of the image like a photo frame, Alex watches everything unfold, returning to the canvas after a few minutes spent idly gazing.

A flurry of brushes in pressure point strikes, precise and natural. A figure with a cheap bouquet. A cat lounging in the light. A couple enjoying a meal outside a cafe. An air of indecision, perhaps doubt in the fibers of the cloth. Or a tugging feeling from the frame pulling taut. Carole King’s “Tapestry” spinning in the corner.

Alex paints the time away. Until the sun is almost gone. Monday coming to a close, her glasses perched along the bridge of her nose giving off a dull ache. Her legs always hurt after a full day of standing like this. It makes her feel like a dancer, although she likes to think her brush is more eloquent than her body.

Final touches complete, Alex puts away her paints and records, rolls her sleeves back down, and goes to draw the curtains closed when she feels a buzz from her pocket. She pulls out her phone to find one new notification.

<div class="block-quote monospace">
“are you busy?”
</div>

The message was from a close friend, and sure enough, looking outside the window Alex could see Kali standing in front of the art gallery, gazing up at her second floor studio. Instead of answering, Alex simply gave Kali a thumbs up and a subtle grin, closing the curtain. Grabbing a jacket, a beanie, and a pair of shoes, she was downstairs and out the door without hesitation.

    “So what do you think?”

Alex stared intently at the large wall-mounted canvas, her chin in her hand as she analyzed every detail.

The composition was incredible. Forms and flowing colors always turning the eye back into the piece, never leaving the soft borders of the image. Sharp angular lines and geometric drawings like schematics effortlessly interleaved with long, raw swathes of layered colors. Something about the abstract nature of the painting began to take shape as a Chinese imperial dragon, or an ouroboros. Smaller details stood out like humanoid figures, like shades or spirits, or small phrases of poetry written in fine print between bright panes of color. Perhaps even the vague idea of a sunset throwing light out at the viewer from behind neon towers swirling with architectural majesty.

    “Wow. I mean, your stuff has always had this charm to its stylistic fusion, but this is something else.”

    “You really think so?”

    “Of course. It’s no wonder they’re displaying your work here. This is some professional shit, right here.”

Kali seemed to smile with her whole body at that line.

    “Thanks, Lex. That really means a lot.”

Alex continued admiring Kali’s latest achievement. She was still in awe that her friend had managed to have her work displayed in a real art gallery. She felt so much pride in her friend, but also a strange humming uneasiness. Or perhaps a desire to fulfill her own dreams of artistry, still learning to refine her skills.

Alex thought about how long Kali had been back in town. It was about two years after graduation when Kali came back from the East Coast. Something about an opportunity in New York, but it must have fallen through. In that period, Alex continued honing her craft, attempting to work part-time while selling her artwork online. She hadn’t realized how much she missed Kali until she was finally back in her life. Even now, looking at Kali gave Alex a pang of regret for not keeping in touch while she was away. The ragged and wild auburn hair, almost red in sunlight. Earrings dangling some unknown gem from each ear. She wore a jacket over a dress complete with belt and flashy necklace. Something about that familiar image reminded Alex of an emptiness somewhere.

Suddenly a question popped into her head.

    “What did you call this piece?”

A brief pause as Kali tried to remember the name in her excitement.

    “Spectacle in Color #4.”

    “Number four?”

Kali gave Alex a coy smile and leaned forward slightly, like a schoolgirl telling a joke.

    “The first three weren’t as big.”

After gazing at the work of Kali’s new gallery colleagues, the two of them decided to go for an evening walk in a nearby park. It was getting dark, and as the light began to leave, the paths of the park were lined with candles.

    “Hey, Lex, is there some kind of event going on tonight? What’s with all the lights?”

    “No clue. I haven’t heard anything about any event. Looks pretty either way.”

The two walked and talked as the air grew colder and the trees seemed to grow taller in the dusk.

    “It’s been a long time since we’ve done something like this. I feel like we used to show each other drawings and play in the park all the time when we were kids.”

    “I know. Isn’t that how we met in the first place? I feel like I remember you showing me some shitty little drawing of a dog, and I absolutely loved it.”

Kali laughed at her memory, and Alex returned a laugh of her own.

    “It was a cat, but yeah, that sounds about right.”

A brief silence.

    “I really missed this kind of stuff while you were away.”

Another silence.

    “I know. I missed it, too.”

A long pause this time as they passed candle after candle. Alex was unsure of what to say. There was some feeling like an iceberg trying to flip over and reveal itself. She couldn’t turn it over.

Finally Kali broke the dead silence.

    “Do you hate me?”

The question didn’t register with Alex for a good few seconds. After a moment she looked at Kali with confusion.

    “What? Why would I, I mean, how could you think that? Why would I hate you?”

Kali spoke firmly, choosing her words carefully. They came slowly at first, but more quickly and confidently as she grasped what she was trying to say.

    “I just... I feel like you’re hiding something from me. Maybe. Back at the gallery, it seemed like my work was giving you mixed feelings. I could see it on your face. And now, now you’re bringing up the past, my time in NYC. It feels like you resent me or something. Do you have something to say to me, Alex?”

At this point both of them were stood still in the middle of the path, facing each other a few paces apart. They seemed to be alone, besides a pair of geese meandering across a nearby field.

Alex took her time finding the right words to say, unsure of what they were even as she spoke them.

    “Uh... I... I think... I, I’m jealous. Of you. Or, no, maybe that’s not right... I missed you, and you left me, and I had to, to... I had to try and make a life for myself, alone. And you went off and played around New York like some playground while I slaved away trying to get by. And then, you come back, and your paintings are getting hung up in galleries like it’s nothing.”

Alex’s voice was getting shakier now, but more passionate as well, shifting back and forth between accusatory and afraid.

    “And I still can’t draw or paint anything worth shit! It’s like you stole my dream from me, and you don’t even get it! And I, I can’t help but feel a little humiliated, and... and... I, you, I don’t know what to do anymore... I don’t know what I’m doing anymore............. I missed you... so much... and now I don’t understand how I feel anymore...”

Alex trails off, standing almost hunched over looking at the ground, defeated. Her eyes dancing between flickering candles at her feet, the fiery light becoming foggy and unclear as her eyes are filled with the beginnings of tears.

Kali takes a step forward, and then several more, pulling Alex into her arms. Alex’s head rests forlornly on Kali’s chest as she begins to cry in earnest. Several minutes pass.

    “I wasn’t trying to abandon you, Lex. I was chasing my own dreams. And I was working my ass off just like you are. Don’t think for one second I had forgotten about my childhood friend back home, all the memories I’d made with her. All the incredible artwork she’d made, the countless times she’d inspired me or helped me through hardships. Don’t you dare think I’d forgotten about you. How could I?”

Kali pauses, breathing in deeply and exhaling slowly.

    “Please don’t hate me, Lex. I can’t live with that.”

    Looking down at the top of Alex’s beanie-covered head, “Lex, tell me you don’t hate me. I need to hear it.”

Alex wraps her arms around Kali’s jacket, now covered in a wet sheen of tears, and answers between sniffling pauses.

    “I love you, you goddamn idiot.... now let’s get out of here.... before someone sees us like this.”

Kali stands stunned and expressionless as Alex continues walking ahead, back in the direction of her apartment.

Up in the studio, Alex is putting things away while Kali roots around her record collection.

    “Oooh, you have “Tapestry”! This is a classic. Mind if I throw it on?”

    “Knock yourself out.”

Kali puts it on the turntable and joins Alex standing at the easel in the center of the room. When she approaches, Alex holds her arm close to her side.

    “Is this what you’ve been working on recently?”

    “Yeah, I just put the finishing touches on it before you came.”

    “Is it some kind of scene?”

    “...Yeah, I guess. I was inspired by my view of the street from the window.”

    “Oh yeah, now I can see it. There’s the flower shop, and there’s a lady with some flowers, and there’s the art gallery, and there’s even a little kitty outside the cafe.”

    “It’s not as abstract or interesting as Spectacle in Color. Honestly, I think it looks boring. But it has this kind of realistic charm to it.”

    “...What’s it called?”

    “...Rituals.”
