Along the beaten trail between a window of trees. The waterfront watchtower looks down on a sea of flocking canoes. Across the still water sits the great firepit in the center of a stone amphitheater. Up ahead where the trail bends off to the right, the rocks fall away slowly into the reeds and ferns below a view of the mess hall. A bare flagpole, no smoke or steam from the chimneys and vents, the sun is going down over the dark green hillside, over the tops of the ancient mysterious trees. To the left a steep path of stone steps leads up the sheer ridge to the first aid hut. Behind me is a long walk from the trading post, that soft humming of the slushie machine, the neon glow of bent tubes and bulbs.

I move up the trail until I've rounded the bend under the mess hall. A pair of squirrels race along the shapes of trees by the dirt and log stairs, and I follow them up to the large wooden building. There are no sounds of cooking or kitchen staff working within. Only the strangely warped echoes of shouts and exclamations from the lake, canoes still circling and pushing their way ahead. The flagstones are cracked and mosaic-like, but there are no weeds growing in their spaces. Everything is trimmed and cultivated. To the right looking out into the air between the trees where the lake sits like a postcard are two stone benches, one placed on each side of a large metal sundial. An old faded bronze triangle stoicly straight as the day it was put into place. It produces no shadow today.

Further down the trail the path bends right along the edge of the lake, and opens up into a field. A great green rectangle that sits snugly up against the shore, proudly showing off the tall cattails and congregations of algae at its banks. A few groups of people are out and about the field, playing ultimate frisbee, practicing their skits for their time to shine at the campfire, or just milling about and talking. One boy is combing a corner of the field with a metal detector. I get closer to see what exactly he’s doing with it.

He’s concentrated on a particular spot furthest from the lake. I can hear the metallic squawk of his detector going off from time to time like a Geiger counter.

	"What are you looking for?"

	"Whatever I can find, I suppose."

He brings the plate of the detector across the grass in wide sweeping arcs, like a scythe. His body moves with a kind of fluidity, even though the long metal arm of the detector makes him look like a machine, a cyborg. He circles in on a central point by listening to the sharp tinny beeps, and then kneels down with a garden trowel. He begins to pick at the earth, digging up clumps of well-kept grass, until he finds what the detector was yelling about. He repeats this process numerous times.

It’s never anything particularly special, like buried treasure or a time capsule. A dull button, a spent bullet casing, an old unknown coin, part of a busted metal chain. He keeps at it for quite some time, longer than I know. I leave him to his search after a few unearthings.

I walk further to the end of the field where another path opens into a clearing. There a cluster of beat up burlap tents are stood on pallets of wood like forest cul-de-sacs. The occassional firepit, folding chairs placed, ties and ropes like laundry lines, little inventions of lashings and wood. I walk beyond the main firepit where many people sit, enjoying a late afternoon snack or a bright slushie they acquired from the trading post, until I come to my tent. I lift the heavy fabric flap, curling it and folding it up around the wooden crossbeam angled to the side. I sit on the thin mattress on the hard unforgiving metal mesh cot, and look out the makeshift door of the tent.

The sun is poking fingers of light through the hard line angles of the trees. Crickets begin to sing into the evening. The shouts of the lake are faint, almost unreal. My father is somewhere out there on the water, or perhaps on his way back to camp. I do not remember the tune that kept playing with my head as I sat there. Most likely some chorus round or mess hall chant that had been drilled into my brain from the beginning of the week. No breeze is blowing, the forest makes no move against the quiet. I think about the people I had known in school. About the countless other camping trips I had been on. About the rumors of some camp staff making out behind the trading post. About the short sentences I had written for a course on observing nature. About the concerts I had been a part of, the performances I'd adored. About the little trinkets and bits of ancient artifacts that boy had been rediscovering with his metal arm.

I think about many things like this for quite a while. The light fades. The moon rises over the lake. I am in my sleeping bag, despite the oppressive temperature, staring up at the wooden crossbar of the tent. Tracking the path of a camel cricket as it meanders along the grains, along the fabric's shape.

Softly time beats like a heart. Slowly moving along the breath of the night. Wispy tendrils of waiting in a land submerged by slumber. Somehow there is no regret in that place. I remember this peacefully, now.

That must have been 2012, sometime in the middle of July. I was only 13 then, and there are parts of me that are still there in those woods. Smiling in the dark as I sit and watch the reeds sway gently at night.
