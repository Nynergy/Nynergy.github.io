Another concept piece about the world that Clover inhabits. For this one, I
decided to continue their journey into Hax Veibrus, and what they found there.
The Hax is dark, somewhat dreary, and dense. Drenched in religious thought.

I wanted to create some kind of ceremony for Clover to witness, and decided on a
kind of public service at the cathedral. The idea is to focus on the religious
and political mindset of the Church, and to set up a kind of dichotomy between
the Desired and Undesired, the sins of the flesh, and the purity of the vibrant
soul. Just some basic ideacrafting for the basis of the religion.

Let me know what you think. Thanks for reading.

Dark towers crawl the crowded skies over Hax Veibrus. The mass of black
religious fixtures, sparse iconography of the Church, and myriad black robed
figures dot the burgeoning settlement surrounding the local convent. Along the
eastern hillsides are pockets of low houses overlooking the valley, where a
massive dome of wrought metal and dark glass sits within a cluster of black
towers and market squares. Along the ridgeline to the north are solitary
watchers, crude black and gray crucifixes - not entirely subtle reminders of
the ruling religious mindset. On the far west end, just beyond the curtain of
tall dark structures of Hax Veibrus, is a far smaller tower, just a few
stories high. A regional office where the Haxei tends to the House and
prepares for visitations with the Founts.

People in dim dress loiter between buildings, many clad in the black robes of
the clergy. Conversing outside of homes and shops, walking to and from
business centers, running errands between neighborhoods and chapels. Monks and
other clergy gathered in groups, giving warm smiles to locals under the pewter
sky. Lyhei and their fellow caretakers chaperoning groups of children with
silver hair. Administrative officials shuffling between carts and stands in a
hurry toward the cathedral dome.

Clover wanders the puzzling, winding streets in the chill. Descending the
levels of buildings along the hill in layers and rings, following switchbacks
and stairs. At a break in the bleak structure facades, the sprawling valley
unfurls below. The menacing towers are a wall around the Hax from a distance,
but within is a dense, populous city low to the ground. A colony of homes and
schools and rearing houses surrounding the grand cathedral dome, this shadowy
crystal semisphere at the base of the valley.

As what little light of day there is begins to fade, streams of people are
gathering at the dome. Windows of buildings begin to flicker with light, and
Clover descends further toward the congregation of black robes around the
cathedral.

From outside the massive building, Clover could feel the familiar tension of
the event. Growing up in their rearing house, Clover had felt this same
quieted spirit shared among other members of the congregation. But there was
more to this night, a pointed anxiety or worry from certain people, many of
which were younger, perhaps wearing their robes for the first time.

As the crowd began filing in through the large front doors, Clover slipped
into the mass of people and followed. The mouth of the dome swallowed them in
shadow as they entered, only a faint ambient glimmer lighting the way through
rows and rows of pews before a great center pulpit. The many facets of the
crystalline ceiling above shone like stars reflected through glass, casting
dim blue and green shades on the faces of the congregation.

As people began taking their seats, Clover followed the crowd as they filed
into the first few pews. From this view of the pulpit, Clover could see a
series of blue and green flames lining torches and hanging fixtures around the
main platform, illuminating the dark crystal lectern. Just in front of and
below the main platform was a second lower platform, with stairs leading from
the main aisle up to a metal table adorned with gems and religious
inscriptions.

Clover immediately recognized what was happening. The table was a familiar
ritual implement. Covered in the appropriate passages from a variety of the
Church's religious texts. Leather straps at each corner. A wire stand off to
one side, the top of which held a wickedly curved knife.

The anxiety of the congegration became all the more familiar to Clover. This
was not just a ceremony, but a public showing of religious and political
piety.

After most everyone was seated, the quiet murmur of exchanging pleasantries
dissolved into a knowing silence. The Haxei, with wild silvery-blue hair down
to the small of their back and an old feminine grace to their slow movements,
made their way to the pulpit from the front entrance. Trailing behind them two
by two came more black robes, this time with dull silvery hoods over their
heads. About twenty or so followed, and behind them came two monks on either
side of a brown-haired man, escorting him down the main aisle. Clad in the
ceremonial white rags, he stood out like the Sun among the shadowy figures.
His face was crestfallen, not quite accepting what was about to happen.

The two rows of following figures split one to either side of the pulpit as
they approached the main platform. The Haxei took their spot at the stand and
placed the hymnal in position, open to a specific page. The monks and the man
stopped just short of the table, facing up to the Haxei, waiting.

The plate glass silence stood over them as the Haxei gazed out over the
congregation, steadying themselves. After a sharp intake of breath, they began
to recite the familiar melodic passages.

<div class="block-quote italics">
The flow of man from birth to death <br>
As time begets the labored breath <br>
The pool of life begins to grow <br>
And here the future opens, <br><br>

We see it now
</div>

The monks bring the man down onto the table. His face darkens in worry, though
he does not resist. He understands its futility. The hooded figures begin to
chant along with the Haxei as the next verse comes.

<div class="block-quote italics">
The world of wisdom flooding through <br>
With eyes of tempered crystal truth <br>
The fleshly fires we cannot mend, <br>
And tepid waters, <br><br>

Put to end
</div>

The man is strapped against the gleaming metal. He makes no movements, eyes
closed. His skin is slick with sweat in the cold blue light. A chorus of
voices picking up, the hall of the cathedral reverberating. The congregation
picks up with the next verse.

<div class="block-quote italics">
The withered vines and roots of man <br>
Do bind us to the rotted land <br>
In cleansing soil of blameless spirit <br>
Man will cower, <br><br>

He does fear it
</div>

One monk retrieves the curved blade from its stand. They present it to the
other monk, who bows and takes it. The ceiling pulses with sound coming down
from all angles, this rising pitch of voices. Clover watches as the monk
slices through the man's white rags, from the collar down to the crotch. He is
not touched by the blade, still caught in his unwilling world of compliance.
The monks remove his rags, and he lays bare upon the low slab.

As the next verse picks up, Clover feels the words come. A familiar dream, a
song they've heard many, many times. They sing along.

<div class="block-quote italics">
We prune the nature, blessed under
</div>

The knife is lifted up into air, catching blue light for a moment.

<div class="block-quote italics">
The seeds of sin are torn asunder
</div>

The knife comes down across the man's groin. There is no scream, as there
usually is. Only gritted teeth and a muffled shout as he holds his tongue.

<div class="block-quote italics">
Blooming bright and solid whole
</div>

The man's severed genitals are handed to the Haxei, who lifts them into the
air over the pulpit. Their arm is wrapped in a sapphire shimmer as the flesh
is consumed in blue fire.

<div class="block-quote italics">
Seize the future,
</div>

The Haxei descends the platform to the table, the man still squirming with
closed eyes. They place a hand, still ashen and covered in a blue glow, over
his wound. Another blue flame appears, and the wound is sealed.

<div class="block-quote italics">
The vibrant soul
</div>

The hymn stops, and the hall is silent once more. Only the small wimpering of
the man can be heard. The Haxei motions to the monks who begin to unstrap the
man's limbs from the table, and begins reciting the typical closing
statements.

"We are all born into the tepid waters of the flesh, yearning to burst from
its shackles, but unable to do so. To birth neither a man nor a woman, but
something outside of the realms of the flesh, is to be Desired. Having brought
into our world the Undesired, you have seen the punishment of the flesh."

The monks help the man sit up and face the Haxei, who he looks at with wide
open eyes. His skin still clammy, his limbs unsure of where they are, what
they should be doing. He is at once a ghost, and a newborn child.

"By the teachings of the Founts and the holy texts, you have received a
separation from your burden, your withering root. You are forgiven."

The Haxei embraces the man, and after a moment, he returns it with a vague
confusion. After this, the monks begin escorting the man back out through the
main aisle. His gait is staggered, only kept upright by the arms of the monks.
The Haxei turns to the congregation.

"You here have witnessed the struggles of the flesh, and the purification of
the waters. Our world moves forward into the future our ancestors believed in.
Be at peace in your homes, and may the vibrant soul be within you, always."

They turn and head back behind the pulpit, out of view, the hooded figures
following close behind. As the congregation begins to stand and murmur once
more, Clover gets up and exits the cathedral.

Only a faint gray light remains of the evening. The monks and the man are
nowhere to be seen. Perhaps he's reuniting with his son or daughter, his
worried wife. Surely his scars will never leave him, but his soul will be more
vibrant. So the passages do say.

Clover begins searching the evening for a rearing house to stay at.
