An ongoing story I started writing back in the beginning of May. Mostly an attempt at writing something expressive about nature, while also exploring an alien landscape. The story centers around the experiences of Isaac, an explorer and cartographer on an alien planet, as he journeys outside of his camp.

If it helps your reading experience at all, I may or may not have written this while listening to Tim Hecker's 2009 album _An Imaginary Country_ :P

A thick blue fog was rolling in underneath the still canopy. Billowing out like a pyroclastic flow. Scurrying around the dark iron trunks, between layers of dead foliage and mud, shrill calling voices of insects. As day began to fade, Palatia and Tiria rose in the east over the distant ridges, marked with their blazing fires of expedition. Hives of hastily constructed tents and taverns and great firepits, dotting the horizon's spine. Tiny columns of smoke reaching up into the dimming sky, making the mountains look to be a gargantuan machine, spewing exhaust up into the thick atmosphere.

Climbing up over the rock pile, Isaac stood and watched the wisps of black against sundown. They seemed so far away from him, now. How long had he been traveling? He sat down on top of the pile and pulled open his satchel, unfurling the inner flaps like a roll of tools. Selecting a pencil and a compass, he brought out a sheet of aged brown paper filled with coarse lines and sketches. Diagrams of natural ecosystems, observations, drawn images of birds and insects and various plants. Isaac steadied his compass and wrote down a bearing, adding to a growing map of the area, its loose topography marked in isolines and symbols.

As he finished jotting down his new location, a flock of birds took flight over the red treetops. Slender gray birds with long necks, their sharp wings making angular, cutting beats against the irregular rhythm of insect voices. Isaac followed their flight toward the western end of the forest, taking note of their long, sweeping flight paths, swelling and dropping in lines like a river. He sketched out their formation on his paper, little marks in a flowing congregation.

After his latest additions were tucked away back into the satchel, he took a drink from his canteen and set out again further into the forest. He knew he needed to find a good spot to set up camp for the night, his bedroll weighing on his tired body. Delving further into the brush, a trail began to take shape, flattened down from the constant passage of game along the ridgeline. Isaac followed the trail, passing all manner of peculiar plant growths and gem-eyed insects. Many of them were larger than his hand, chittering away on the side of a tree, watching him like leaves with bright eyes that caught the last remaining light streaming through the treetops.

Eventually the trail broke out into a clearing, and Isaac decided to set up camp before the moons got too high overhead. He set down his belongings and began searching for some fallen boughs in the brush along the sides of the clearing. More silver leafy insects seemed to follow him, watching from the ends of tree limbs. He found a few good candidates for a tent frame and set them up underneath a large tree on the north side of the clearing, draping a large cloth over the sticks to make a humble tent. It was getting particularly dark now, and the fog seemed to thicken even further as it rolled between the trees. Isaac scrounged for firewood before his sight failed him in the darkness, and sat warming by a fire before long. On his lap, a small mess kit holding a meager dinner, his body thankful for the rest and nourishment. The sound of the insects was fading now, though he could still see them crawling on the trees, their eyes catching even the dim moonlight. Tiria was in alignment, her pale crimson veil of light making their eyes like burning garnets in the shadows.

As the fire waned and flickered, and his stomach filled, Isaac grew tired and set out his bedroll under the tent. He admired some of his sketches and diagrams by the fire before quenching it and retiring to bed, where he found it difficult to sleep. His body was exhausted, but his mind was filled with questions and ever-growing images of birds and insects and foreign landscapes. How far had he traveled from his camp? It was only three days from his departure but it felt like they were growing apart so quickly and vastly. He could not see the orange glow of basecamp fires along the distant mountains. Only the flashing, skittering eyes of insects as they wandered about his dwelling, watching this alien among them through the fog. He thought about many of the wild plants he encountered, wondering about their life cycle and how seasons affected this area. He imagined what this place would look like covered in snow. He hadn't seen any snow since coming to this place, and wasn't sure how cold it would get.

Isaac's thoughts swirled and collided against each other for some time before he settled into a half-sleep, faceless voices lulling him deeper into that hypnagogic place. Some chanting or chorus of phrases, occassionally a singled out phrase making it through to his tired mind.

"...and the history of the land...among the mountains in dens of about 10 or 15...in alignment with Palatia it becomes teal...oceans are vast storms of...200 years ago...making its way along the curve of the rivers...you'll know when the time comes, the leaves...some rumbling across the plains to the south...slender necks and long sharp beaks...metals and ores under the topsoil...meet me outside of camp, Isaac...river deltas with lamps...asymmetric face of the landscape...steeples and old ruins...where did you go...the leaves, they become black."

After much tossing and turning, Isaac finds his mind is silent once more. Only the dull whirring of life outside the tent, just a faint chirping of insects. The litany of voices is replaced by a mosaic of ruby watchers among the warm pitch black of night.

Isaac sleeps.
