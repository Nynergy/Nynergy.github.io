## East 1 - 16m 47p 22366s 23z 56z :: 8s

<hr>

Rose sits cross-legged at the unsteady folding table, eyes fixated on the
screen of her laptop. A constant digital clicking fills the cramped dorm room,
empty of all sound besides the occasional loose creaking of the table. The
stark light of the screen throws wild shadows of Rose's unkempt hair onto the
wall. She's still as a stone, her hands kept in her lap when not speedily
typing or clicking for a short moment. A tiny grin sometimes coming to her
lips, as if reading something amusing.

Suddenly, the tinny laptop speakers bark "Pon!" into the dimly lit room, and
Rose's grin diminishes into a nonplussed look of admonishment. More furious
clicking and typing, sometimes punctuated by another call of "Pon!" or "Chii!"
This continues for a few moments before Rose throws a smug look at the screen,
the phrase "Riichi!" proclaimed from the shaky table.

Arms now crossed, Rose watches the screen as the clicking continues. Her
smugness fades as time goes on, no more exclamations from the table. A minute
goes by, still nothing. Rose's expression settles on one of resignation, and a
snap of bamboo from the laptop signals that her concerns are not misplaced.

"Ron!"

West Seat goes out off East's tile, and the game is over. Points are tallied
up, and the final scores levied. Rose comes away with an ambivalent 3rd place.
She types a terse message into the chat and closes the laptop, falling over
onto her bed in defeat. The sullen overcast glow filters in through the peach
curtains, making the whole room pale. Rose blows a stray hair out of her mouth
and eyes up the stack of notebooks and papers taking up all the room on her
desk.

That disorganized pile sends a spike of anxiety through Rose's chest. Her
fingers were reaching blazing fast speeds just a moment ago, but they lock up
at the thought of writing even one paragraph about art history or, god forbid,
20th century North American poetic movements. She decides to stave off the
wave of rolling doubts about her future plans with some fresh air.

<hr>

The dreary weather seems to be keeping most other people inside this weekend.
Rose doesn't mind, it just means less people will see her wandering around
campus in her unwashed sweatpants and oversized pullover. Dark clouds climb
overhead, and the flagstones are dotted with the first staccato drops of rain.
The image reminds Rose of pointillism, and her hands begin to cramp up once
again. She ignores the thought and continues walking, ducking under the
overhangs of buildings whenever possible.

Being caught out in the rain doesn't upset Rose; quite the contrary, really.
There's something about the rain that makes her think of those cozy days stuck
inside playing mahjong without her parents asking her why she wasn't playing
outside or hanging out with friends. The rain is a comforting thing, a reason
to stay away from the world.

But that doesn't mean Rose particularly enjoys standing in the middle of
pouring rain. As larger drops begin to fall more heavily, she takes refuge in
an alcove connected to the entrance of a dining hall. A few scattered students
are running for cover or pulling out their umbrellas.

Rose pulls out her phone and navigates to a popular mahjong forum she
frequents as she waits for the torrent of rain to subside. Not much is new,
just a couple posts discussing some recent tournament results. As she's
reading up on the opening rounds, a chat message comes up with a familiar
handle.

```
hatsuro: hey, good game earlier!
```

Rose can't hide the smile on her face. She responds.

```
roze_petalz: you're just happy cause you won :P
roze_petalz: i'll kick your ass next time for sure ;)

hatsuro: we'll see about that >:)
hatsuro: i never asked before, how did you learn to play? whoever taught you
         must have been one hell of a teacher.
```

Rose thinks for a second, and she's taken back to her childhood. Staying over
at her grandmother's house, she would host a game night with her old lady
friends every week. She remembers watching them play a strange game with odd
tiles and complex rules. She was struck with wonder, and her grandmother took
the chance to pass on her riichi mahjong prowess. Rose was never the same
after training under her grandmother.

```
roze_petalz: and even now, not a day goes by where I don't ron some randoms
             online for at least a couple hours.

hatsuro: i believe you, i see you online what seems like all day. your grandma
         must have been a seriously talented player.
```

The thought of her grandmother brings a sad angle to Rose's smile. The rain
keeps falling as she recalls the last game they played together.

_Rose, you've grown better than me at the game. I've really lost it, eh?_ <br>
_No, gramma, you haven't lost it! Don't think like that._ <br>
_...Rose, listen. I want to give you something._ <br>
_What is it?_ <br>
_You should have this game set. It's the one I've been using for ages, the one you learned to play the game with. I'm sure it means a lot to you._ <br>
_No, gramma, this is yours. You haven't given up on playing, have you?_ <br>
_No, no. I just think it would better serve someone like you, little Rosie..._

Three months later, she was gone. Like she knew the end was coming. That set
is still sitting somewhere in her dorm room, unused since that day. Can't get
much use out of a tile set when you have no one to play with. That's where her
online mahjong addiction took off, and where she met hatsuro, another regular
of the site.

As the rain lets up a little, the clouds begin circling Rose's mind, consumed
with thoughts of her grandmother. She begins typing to hatsuro.

```
roze_petalz: go ahead and lobby up, i'll be online in a few minutes.

hatsuro: still lookin for that W, huh? ;P you're on
```

Rose makes her way back to the dorm as the rain lessens to just a light mist.
Her hair gets damp and starts sticking to the back of her neck, and her
glasses fog up a bit, but she doesn't mind, or doesn't seem to notice. That
set collecting dust also collects her thoughts, tiles swimming around in her
head, morphing hands moving in and out of tenpai, swapping melds, falling over
at the call of "Ron!"

The thoughts of sou, pin, and man collapse into an image of her desk still
cluttered with notes and assignments not yet completed. Rose's hands cramp up,
and she continues walking back to her digital oasis in the misting rain.
