For quite a long time now, I've had this recurring theme for a character and a world. It was mostly inspired by the writing of Ursula K. Le Guin, most notably her novel _The Left Hand of Darkness_. I'm always coming back to this image of an androgynous character on some spirit journey, or a world controlled by transhumanist religious thought. These concepts can seem fairly obtuse or obscure from a narrative perspective, but I can't shake the desire to experiment with them.

And so, I've brewed up this small taste of the world. A place far in the future where a sect of people are born and bred with mysterious powers, and without a given sex. A society reminiscent of an old world theocracy, ruled by the morals of transhumanist texts, steeped in the deep political intrigue of a corrupt clergical hierarchy.

Just a sample of the writing before I dive too deep into it. Magic, religion, social commentary, etc. What more could you want, right?

Clover wanders a land of brambles and black towers. Vast oceans and relentless
jungles. Salt marshes and crystal ravines. Sprawling capitals and myriad
believers.

To find a Grand Height, this trek to Zion. They weave patterns of magic from
the fibers of will. Something growing like vines clinging still to their mind.
Remnants of the Church's teachings, tracts of old onion skin pages tucked and
folded in a satchel. Recycled journals filled with questions and other mad
ravings of a thousand miles.

Upon an open plain of flowers butting up against the sea. Obsidian fingers
crowning posts from the distant earth, arrow slit eyes dark, without purpose
or spirit. Zenith light falling over the grass.

Pulling a slip of brittle paper from the satchel, Clover reads the printed
text, a familiar passage of youth:

_And as the seas ebb and flow with the tide,_ <br>
_So too the tepid waters within_ <br>
_Will rise and overtake the vibrant soul._

_Quiet the raging stillness to stone,_ <br>
_And remember the power of the words_ <br>
_From which you draw your existence._

An emerald shimmer skitters along their skin as the memory of power takes
shape, mouthing the words so deeply instilled.

_To become ever onward, outward, and otherwise._

The shimmer envelops the fragile paper and begins creasing, folding, morphing
the form. Clover examines the surroundings, drawing in patterns and senses
from the shapes of the land. Angles of rocky formations. Tendrils of roots and
veins of ore. Cresting waves crashing below the bluffs. Solid lines of
charcoal jutting from a horizon of rolling hills. The graceful unending spiral
of a flower.

The paper curls in Clover's palm, wrapped in the emerald shimmer. Peaks and
valleys come into view on the surface, a topography of the land. Lines of type
moving along the slip to form a line of travel. Divining the path to Zion.

The line moves through a forest of pillars on the page. Looking up and to the
north, Clover spots the pillars in question, a grove of black towers. A number
of local convents of the Church, likely grouped around some cathedral or
regional office. Looking back down at the small map, the text shifts to mark
the pillars with a name: _Hax Veibrus_. "House of Vibrant Soul".

Clover folds the map in a shower of green light, the slip now expended.
Jotting the new information in a journal and tightening their thin cloak
against the searching breeze, they head north.

The pillars of the House stretch up into the dull sky. Smooth, nearly
featureless totems. Gazing down at the solitary figure making a way across the
field. Clover felt them watching, even at such a distance.

Cold wind running through their silvery hair, disturbing the faint green
shade, Clover moves onward.

I may add more little conceptual excerpts like this in the future. I like the idea of playing around in this world a bit before committing to anything. Let me know what you think of the idea. Hopefully it doesn't distract too much from all the other narratives I'm still in the middle of developing.
