        <div class="content-block centered-text">
        The world lay quiet for many centuries. All the people scattered across the
        corners of the earth, scurrying between quiet hamlets and along winding trade
        routes, or holed up in the sprawling cities and towns of many cultures. On
        that strange world where the enormous nature seemed without footholds, history
        itself flowed and reshaped with the curious energy in everything -- lost in
        time as rain disappears from a thirsty meadow, and blooming anew just the
        same. <br> <br>

        In this way, the Ancient Flesh has no origin, no reason for being. It simply
        is, as surely as the moons dance above and the tides dance below. It is seen,
        and it is felt, and therefore is. The affliction of all people, birthed into
        it as had their parents, and their parents before them since life began. <br> <br>

        And so time has moved slowly across the wide regions where people stake claim
        of the land and build cities against mountains and cliffs and coastlines.
        Quiet spreads over fields and hamlets, without war or famine for centuries.
        The Church expands, benevolent and wide. Seeking a higher self, beyond that of
        all people. From high towers in far off capitols, the Founts spout their
        wisdom. The words echo across domains, through city walls and homes, relished
        by all people. <br> <br>

        And those words are a veil over great sleeping machines, memories like fossils
        of a time older than time. As their mechanisms churn and rumble, the world
        falls into dust, though they do not see it. And the crumbling world cries out
        in a desperate voice -- <br> <br>

        And Clover hears, and is struck with a mood.
