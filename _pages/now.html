I have the sort of creative energy that comes and goes with seasons. I put
things down, pick them back up, abandon them, obsess over them, and forget
ideas I had just this morning.
</p>

<p>
Here are some things I'm working on now.
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Writing a fantasy novel, currently codenamed "Petrichor Sacrament".</li>
    <li>Restructuring and tending to my homelab.</li>
    <li>Reading up on anarchist literature and praxis.</li>
    <li>Sitting on a couple different ideas for albums, including some recorded demos.</li>
</ul>
