<h2>Illogical Sketches</h2>

<p>
Illogical Sketches is a small collection of physical sketches I made while
putting together the manuscript for my third volume of poetry, 'Drift
Illogical'. The sketches are pen/pencil on watercolor paper, and were made with
the aid of a ruler for straight lines and edges.

<p>
Rather than trying to experiment with color or digital manipulation in order to
evoke any particular feeling, I let my quarantine-addled imagination conjure up
whatever aimless and illogical things it wanted to. The results were
particularly geometric, sometimes unsettling, sometimes beautiful.

<p>
These pieces were eventually included as artwork in the final published version
of 'Drift Illogical'.
