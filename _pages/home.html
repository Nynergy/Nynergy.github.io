<b><em>Lexica Chromatica</em></b> is a repository of ideas, notes, links,
arrows, paths, dreams, words, sounds, letters, landscapes, and columns of
arbitrary text.  It is where I sleep, and where I sometimes stir the waters.

projects, listen to my <a href="#music">Music</a>, read my
<a href="#writing">Writing</a>, peruse my <a href="#artwork">Artwork</a>,
or learn more <a href="#about">About</a> me.
