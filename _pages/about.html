<h2>About</h2>

<img class="masthead" src="static/mastheads/about.jpg" />

<p>
My name is Ben Buchanan, and I made the stuff you're looking at on this site.
Sometimes I write, sometimes I make music, sometimes I create art.  Perhaps I
might spend a week straight programming some tool or interface.  Or maybe I'll
spend far too much time ignoring this site and playing video games, Netrunner,
and online riichi mahjong.
</p>

<p>
I also have a day job where I type on a keyboard and sit in a nice chair. Not
every day is a creative one, and that's okay.
</p>

<p>
I hope you enjoy the stuff I make, or find something interesting on the site.
Thanks for visiting, and be well.
