<h3>Hosting</h3>

<p>
This site is hosted on GitHub Pages, though I am not in love with this fact. I
am currently looking into going self-hosted; time will tell if that ever
becomes a reality.
</p>

<p>
One fun and interesting benefit(?) of hosting my site in a
<a {EXT_LINK} href="https://github.com/Nynergy/Nynergy.github.io/">public GitHub repo</a>
is that previous versions of <em>Lexica Chromatica</em> (of which there are
many) can all be browsed by going back in the commit history and building the
site.
</p>

<h3>Site Construction</h3>

<p>
Once upon a time this site was built with
<a {EXT_LINK} href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, but for reasons that I
expound upon in
<a href="#blog/2025/12/31/I Wrote My Own Static Site Generator in Bash">
    this blog post
</a>, it is now built with
<a {EXT_LINK} href="https://github.com/Nynergy/totem">totem</a>, a custom
static site generator written in pure bash, and created by yours truly.
</p>

<p>
<em>Lexica Chromatica</em> (the current iteration of it, at least) features no
JavaScript. Everything you see is handwritten HTML and CSS, barring the minimal
amount of pseudo-templating I employ as part of using <em>totem</em>.
</p>

<p>
Even the fact that this site functions like a single-page application is
implemented with CSS. It is this implementation that relies on the odd URL
structure utilizing hashes ("#") instead of slashes ("/") for the initial page
routes.
</p>

<h3>Tools Used</h3>

<ul>
    <li><a {EXT_LINK} href="https://github.com/Nynergy/totem">totem</a> (Pure Bash)</li>
    <li><a {EXT_LINK} href="https://www.vim.org/">vim</a></li>
    <li>HTML/CSS</li>
    <li>git/GitHub Pages</li>
</ul>

<h3>Why?</h3>

<p>
I like to use small tools. I like to move slowly. I like to tend my garden.
</p>

<p>
I don't like overstuffed, unnecessary software. I don't like the rushed
mentality of "move fast and break things". I don't like to subject visitors to
the ugliness of the modern web.
</p>

<p>
I made this small site with my bare hands. I've taken my time to think through
design changes, site iterations, user experience, and I'm certain there is
still more to do. I do not track you, or run any analytics beyond what GitHub
Pages does, which as far as I know is out of my control (again, I'd like to
move away from this hosting solution in the future). I don't run ads. I don't
slather shiny dopamine buttons all over the place. I've planted seeds here that
I hope passersby will one day admire as flowers.
</p>

<p>
I did this for you, as much as I did this for me. I hope I am not too selfish
in this.
