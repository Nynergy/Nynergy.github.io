26.01.08 - A Law of Programming
</h4>

<p>
A reminder from today's day at work.
</p>

<p>
<em>There are only 2 types of problems in programming:</em>
</p>

<ol>
    <li>Easy problems that turn out to be difficult.</li>

<p>
Remember when I talked about
<a href="#blog/2024/08/04/A Return to Digital Gardening">joining some webrings</a>?
Well, over a year later, that's now a reality. Links are on the

26.01.03 - 227/???
</h4>

<p>
Since publishing
<a class="link--writing" href="static/writing/Even If I Am Ash.pdf">
    <em>Even If I Am Ash</em>
</a>, I've written nothing but the occasional tanka. At time of writing this
log, I've written 227 tankas, all without titles. I simply number them in
order. I'm not sure why; perhaps I don't want to give them any particular
meaning.

    Having recently replayed the incredible
    <a {EXT_LINK} href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riven">Riven</a>, I'm
    reminded of how Gehn numbered his Ages in much the same way, never giving
    them proper names. I hope that my habit of numbering the tankas does not
    come off as calloused and egotistical as Atrus' father.
</small>
I'd rather let the 5-7-5-7-7 speak for itself.
</p>

<p>
Here's a handful I randomly picked from the collection that I still enjoy after
much time has passed since they were written.

<h4>
26.01.02 - Truth
</h4>

<p>
In writing my fantasy novel, a part of me was worried that if I did not go out
of my way to write something geared toward adult readers, my writing would
devolve into a childrens book. So what? There is no real supremacy of adult
fiction to that meant for children; that is a silly concept best kept to a
silly people.
</p>

<p>
This quote from Ursula K. Le Guin's 1974 essay "Why are Americans Afraid of
Dragons?" is one that stood out to me, and helped me re-align my thoughts on
why I write.
</p>

<blockquote>
    "For fantasy is true, of course. It isn't factual, but it is true. Children
    know that. Adults know it too, and that is precisely why many of them are
    afraid of fantasy. They know that its truth challenges, even threatens, all
    that is false, all that is phony, unnecessary, and trivial in the life they
    have let themselves be forced into living. They are afraid of dragons,
    because they are afraid of freedom."
</blockquote>

<p>
I was so focused on creating a fantasy world that was "real", "adult", and
"reflective" of the world around me, that I neglected the importance of
reflecting the world <em>within myself</em> just as much.

<input id="log-260102-fn-1" type="checkbox"></input>
<small>
    I find it odd that I was not already thinking in this way, as my music has
    been created with this philosophy for years. The title of my album "Inner
    Weather" is even an explicit reference to this habit of reflecting my inner
    state of being in the art I create.
</small>
When making a note of this shift in my thinking, I summed it up like this:
</p>

<blockquote>
    "In writing a fantasy world, the things that, in our world, are hidden
    beneath some layer of understanding, become raised up to the surface. When
    we make a world stranger, more fantastical, more unreal, we paradoxically
    make it a truer world than our own."
</blockquote>

<p>
My book will not be intended for children; it will not be intended for anyone,
I've decided. I will simply write the story that wishes to be written. In this,
I will find the truth of my work, and let that truth impart its own meaning,
which is not for me, as the author, to decide.
</p>

<h4>
25.12.29 - Rituals
</h4>

<img src="static/log/251229.jpg" />

<p>
At the end of every year, after I've put together my annual lists of my
favorite records of the year and my top 100 albums of all time, I like to spend
the final days before New Years listening to some of those records.
</p>

<p>
I like to be intentional about these listening sessions, doing nothing but
sitting in the room and letting the music wash over me. I like to use any
physical copies of the album that I own, if any, be they tapes, CDs, or vinyl
records. Typically I will listen to 2 albums per day in this manner; first, a
top 10 album from this year, then a top 10 album of all time. I like to count
down from 10 in this way, ending the year with my AOTY and my favorite album
ever.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps some people might find this little ritual a bit silly. I like it. It
gives me a deeper appreciation for the collection of music I've curated over
years, and gives me an excuse to intentionally sit still and let my mind take a
break from whatever it was doing all day.
</p>

<p>
Tonight, you've caught me in the image above listening to Close to the Edge by
Yes. Tomorrow I finish this year's listening sessions, and then on into 2026.

25.12.28 - Digital Gardening, Revisited
</h4>

<p>
Digital gardening is not just a practice of pruning (deleting, reorganizing,
culling, etc), but is also a practice of cultivating (growing, shaping,
weaving, etc). It is both of these things at once.
</p>

<h4>
25.12.26 - Slash Pages
</h4>

<p>
If you're reading this, it means you've discovered the existence of at least
one of my <a {EXT_LINK} href="https://slashpages.net/">slash pages</a>. Or
maybe it would be more approriate to call them "hash pages"? There are more.
Now that you've seen one, perhaps try finding others.
