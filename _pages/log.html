25.12.29 - Rituals
</h4>

<img src="static/log/251229.jpg" />

<p>
At the end of every year, after I've put together my annual lists of my
favorite records of the year and my top 100 albums of all time, I like to spend
the final days before New Years listening to some of those records.
</p>

<p>
I like to be intentional about these listening sessions, doing nothing but
sitting in the room and letting the music wash over me. I like to use any
physical copies of the album that I own, if any, be they tapes, CDs, or vinyl
records. Typically I will listen to 2 albums per day in this manner; first, a
top 10 album from this year, then a top 10 album of all time. I like to count
down from 10 in this way, ending the year with my AOTY and my favorite album
ever.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps some people might find this little ritual a bit silly. I like it. It
gives me a deeper appreciation for the collection of music I've curated over
years, and gives me an excuse to intentionally sit still and let my mind take a
break from whatever it was doing all day.
</p>

<p>
Tonight, you've caught me in the image above listening to Close to the Edge by
Yes. Tomorrow I finish this year's listening sessions, and then on into 2026.

25.12.28 - Digital Gardening, Revisited
</h4>

<p>
Digital gardening is not just a practice of pruning (deleting, reorganizing,
culling, etc), but is also a practice of cultivating (growing, shaping,
weaving, etc). It is both of these things at once.

<h4>
25.12.26 - Slash Pages
</h4>

<p>
If you're reading this, it means you've discovered the existence of at least
one of my <a {EXT_LINK} href="https://slashpages.net/">slash pages</a>. Or
maybe it would be more approriate to call them "hash pages"? There are more.
Now that you've seen one, perhaps try finding others.
