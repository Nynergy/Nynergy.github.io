25.12.28 - Digital Gardening, Revisited
</h4>

<p>
Digital gardening is not just a practice of pruning (deleting, reorganizing,
culling, etc), but is also a practice of cultivating (growing, shaping,
weaving, etc). It is both of these things at once.

25.12.26 - Slash Pages
</h4>

<p>
If you're reading this, it means you've discovered the existence of at least
one of my <a {EXT_LINK} href="https://slashpages.net/">slash pages</a>. Or
maybe it would be more approriate to call them "hash pages"? There are more.
Now that you've seen one, perhaps try finding others.
