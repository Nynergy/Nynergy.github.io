Convection waves flutter. Ancient street pieces vibrate in ritual circles.
Mind melter membrane. Harmonic structures. Glass doors and animals. People see
through themselves.

*pervasive silence*

*quite some time*

Filled with fractured. Bits and pieces. Flotsam floating flowers flowing flour
fulcrum folding folders frowning filling falling fullness circle zen loss
nothing left it seems. Seams. Stretching. Funhouse mirrors. Brain is a
balloon. Ballroom scratches skipping jumping cracking clipping. Face in
permanent marker. Squiggly smile smiling.

*distant conversation*

Great Wall, na na? Something more. Idle thoughts on multiplicity. In your
multiples belonging. Escaping fleeing strife. Scaling. Cold scales. No
worries, nothing more than. Simple things. Simple things. Only now. Then
tomorrow gone.

*snap fire names scrolling*

*unpronounceable things*

Rift state. Broken bridges protrusions. Rebar hemorrhage green and red
bleeding. Salvage yard to the next life. A dream connecting dreams. Fusing
ropes tied nooses and clove hitches. In fever you float across divides.

*immeasurable lines in perspective stretching away lightspeed*

Two dreams can join together. Your eyes see me. Me here there and then some.
Struggling for corporeal. Hands brush right through. Your hair.

You remember, no? What we shared?

That sacred burial.

*burial falls in*

*goes quiet*
