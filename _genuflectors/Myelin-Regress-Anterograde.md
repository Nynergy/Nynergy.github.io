Pleased to meet you. Having met before in ages. Been feeling ages for a while,
no? How the towers grow, we don't watch them. They are there and here and all
over under our noses. We do not forget them, though.

Have you forgetting? Knowing only the minimal, passing by. I am not melting
down the bridges. Healthy matter, healthy manner, so and so. Kindly. It's
okay. No more knowing not beyond the mist. Burning up Sun shine all time. It's
okay.

I have the documents. Here within. Findings discoveries. Massive tunnels bored
and sealed bored again machines. Worming through. Hollow space rifting you.
You feel, you do? Yes, yes, and yes. Nothing new.

No end, now. Just walls. Shadows shapes in floodlights. Memories memories
memories paintings fading. I see the you below the space around. Distance.
Terminal.

It's okay. Caught in hypothermia, follow the heat. Sun shine. Deep earth
mother calling calling calling quieter. Still here. It's okay. Lovely flowers.
A good companion makes it, no? Something left behind. We all leave them.

And you? I have the documents. Implements. Sign here. You know this, yes? Last
great moments. In clarity. Ink means much. Much thanks and prayers alleluia.

*jittering scribbling*

Bottles cases partitioned in moderation. Sparse recollected from now on. Done
what we can, do what you are now and ever. Hours up and gone. Other frail
faces. Instructions arrive shortly.

Make it now more than before. Your last. Pleased to met you.

*empty days moving shifting*

You've got mail.
