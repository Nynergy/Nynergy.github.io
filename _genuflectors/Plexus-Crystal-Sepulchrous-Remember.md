Please mark all following you identify as real or otherwise corporeal:

( ) - Sunlight captured caged as animals. <br>
( ) - Heavens ligatured on flypaper Braille tracts and passages. <br>
( ) - My family has left. <br>
(X) - Isolated incidents (i.e. vivid depictions, heinous images, sudden
unwanted returns [which is to say, unrequested terrors, desecrated joys,
or otherwise modified/tampered/sabotaged/rigged/jumped/floundered/lost
dream states], high velocity synapse misfires, pre-burial false alarms,
odd noises, etc.) <br>
( ) - Hands of roiling steam. <br>
( ) - Spiking waves of on and off (but not of off and on).

How long have you?

( ) - A bit. <br>
( ) - Slightly more than. <br>
( ) - Who again is asking? <br>
(X) - Mere moonlight hours. <br>
( ) - Already burned out. <br>
( ) - Unknown (i.e undetermined [e.g. undefined {a.k.a none of the above}])

And how many?

(X) - Many.

Rate your experience.

( ) - Violent charms disregarded. Please send more. <br>
( ) - Euphoric visions gesturing doorways to nowhere fast. Recommended. <br>
( ) - Fizzy drinks in my brain. Sip sip sip. <br>
( ) - In the dead of night I recall things never placed inside myself. Much
praise and posturing 10/10. <br>
( ) - Hermetic seal on my soul. Forget me. <br>
( ) - Glory days come to us at last in shaky appendages stuck with fluids and
thin blankets. Lessening curses to your kin. <br>
(X) - Can't remember. Painless.

Weave the madness in unwavering filibuster (required field):

```
UNSTABLE METAMORPHOSIS MOLTING APART MOUNTAIN CRAGS AND CLEFTS LEFT ALONE
POSTHUMOUS DELIVERIES EPIPHANIES OF REVELATION WALLS OF SOUND AROUND
SURROUNDING BLOWS ASH AWAY APART DECAY AWAY SHEDDING MOLTING METAMORPHOSIS
SKIN. INQUIRING FOR A FRIEND. A FRIEND IN NEED OF SAVIORS. CRUSHED AROUND
BETWIXT LICHEN FUNGUS ROCKS ON STILTS. INDIGO GALAXIES IN MY PALM BURNING
SUPERMASSIVE HOLES DRAWING IN ANCIENT DEBRIS OF TRAUMA. HANG ON TO EACH OTHER.
HANG ON AND HANG ON AND HANG ON. HEALTH VOICES BREAKING DOWN WINDOWS TOP FLOOR
BULWARKS BEGGING RELEASE ON THE HINGES CRUMPLING PAPERS TOSSING FAVORS ASIDE
AT NIGHT IN THE JET LOTS UNDER EYES THEY CANNOT SEE. I AM HERE I AM HERE AND I
AM HERE HERE HERE HERE HERE. WHERE. NOWHERE. FALLING THROUGH PENUMBRA SHADOWS.
SWALLOWING THE MOON MAKER ECLIPSING THE STARS. HOVERING STILLNESS OF BREATH IN
MY THROAT AND THE GOLDEN AGE COMES BACK IN A PYROCLAST RUSH. A QUICK BRUSH
WITH DEATH. I KNOW IT TO BE TRUE. I NEED YOU.
```

Thoughts and Prayers:

*electric chair hymnals begin playing*

*pleasant crackling tune*

Is are medical documents filled with complications? If so, check many:

( ) - Body composed of vulgarities bursting. <br>
(X) - First steps forward go backward and upside down. <br>
(X) - Walls are constructs. <br>
( ) - Whimpering habits waning with age. <br>
( ) - Head caught slipping in multidimensional traffic zones. $50 fine. <br>
(X) - Cannot sleep. Only dreams.

Loved ones?

(X) - I've seen them. <br>
( ) - Gone in the haze. Melted through. <br>
( ) - Too many uncountable years (also applicable: months, eons, days,
lifetimes, weeks, centuries, infinite worlds, and failing memories). <br>
( ) - Never. <br>
( ) - In passing again like conveyors. <br>
( ) - They've seen me.

Poem for the road:

```
BIRDS TOSSING FLOWERS
THEY DROP PETALS IN RAIN
BEHIND ME

AHEAD IS A RIFT
IT IS OPENING
ALONG THE RINGING BELL PATH

AND MY EYES ARE A LATEX FILM
STARING UNENDING DEPTHS
I CONTINUE TO SWALLOW

WAITING SO LONG FOR THE END
NEVER KNEW IT WAS HERE

AND I SHOOK ITS HAND
AS A FRIEND
```

Exist in final thoughts of form and function?

```
ARE THESE THE LAST MOMENTS? LITTLE CHIPPING AWAY THE CLOCK NOISES REMIND ME IN
PATTERNS. MAKE IT LAST. PLEASE.
```
