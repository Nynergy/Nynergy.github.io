"Although cover notes for classical music albums tend to say that the trill of flutes suggests mountain streams and so on, I don't think anybody listens to music with the expectation that they're going to be presented with a sort of landscape painting."

## Preface

I read this quote from a man whose music I greatly respect, his song "Above Chiangmai" in my ears, and I find it quite ironic. Eno's famous suite of ambient records all feature topographical maps as the cover art, and while those maps are not directly landscape paintings, they still convey a sense of _place_ to me. When listening to those albums, especially _Ambient 2_ and _Ambient 4_, I find myself imagining the places depicted by those maps. The feeling of the music is an emotional map in itself, leading the listener through a series of places, or perhaps simply different views of a single place. I feel the latter option is particularly true for the album _The Pearl_, one of many collaborations between Brian Eno and Harold Budd, and one I look to as a sort of "sister album" to _Ambient 2_.

This idea that music (particularly more aesthetic and mood-focused genres such as ambient, drone, vaporwave, instrumental music, etc.) can be related to the concept of landscape, or even a particular landscape, is one that I wholeheartedly accept - even going so far as to blatantly copy Eno's album cover style for my double LP of ambient electronic music _Eastern Experiment // Red Miles_ (which you may come across if you know where to look...). I find that his take on the classical mindset of pairing instrumentation directly to the atmosphere of nature is actually fairly true. It can come off as pretentious in some cases, making an album and its composer seem full of themselves. I prefer to let the listener come to their own conclusions about the mood of the music, the _story_ trying to be told.

But there is definitely something to be said about music that is purposefully attempting to capture the sounds of nature, the rich fullness of noise and melody that can exist in that sphere. When I think of music that tries to do this, my mind immediately jumps to New Age music. Many people have complaints about the pretentiousness of New Age music, the lack of originality, the boring progressions, the list goes on and on. In many cases, I agree with those complaints, but there is one artist that I feel encapsulates everything incredible about the natural mood of New Age music: Hiroshi Yoshimura.

Yoshimura is a well-known Japanese New Age composer, famous for albums like _Green_, _Music for Nine Postcards_, and more. His music often features these natural soundscapes of samples and synthesizers, usually presented in simple, stripped back melodies and pads. Albums like _Green_ and _Nine Postcards_ saw him favor the Yamaha DX7 for its complex FM Synthesis capabilities, and it's this sound that made him famous in the New Age circle. Yoshimura leans into this natural mood, embracing the aesthetics of what Eno was talking about, especially on albums like _Wet Land_, which see him use watery samples and misty walls of synth noise on tracks like "Singing Stream", "Rain Dance", and "Humming Water".

Personally, while I find his early work with the DX7 to be entrancing and highly enjoyable, I prefer his more melodic and playful style on his album _Flora 1987_. Ditching the DX7 for more traditional synthesizers, Yoshimura really flexes his songwriting muscles on this release. Every melody on this album is pure gold, from the opening lick of "Over the Clover", to the sticky earworm piano lines on "Maple Syrup Factory", to the somber cycling refrains of "Silence". Only a few tracks really feature prominent samples, and when they do it's often a sample with a very "airy" quality to it, as opposed to the "watery" samples he was fond of using in his previous work. And yet, while the style leans more toward a poppy, melodic sentiment, that natural mood is never lost. It's this album that really brings me to a bright place, an ever-shifting landscape of light that Yoshimura crafted. Nothing about it reads as pretentious to me, and it only works to solidify my respect for music as a _companion medium_ to landscape painting, as well as art and nature in general.

All of this was really just my way of explaining why landscapes are important to me. My father draws and paints landscapes in many mediums, and we used to do a lot of camping and other outdoor activities. If you read my writing, both poetry and prose, you'll find that landscapes and one's surroundings in general are a recurring theme of my work. I'm fascinated with landscapes, both natural and internal. To me, my art is simply a projection of an internal landscape that I am constantly exploring. Pieces of myself like hills and trees, great features in the earth. And in the exploration is a journey, a logical narrative from point to point. It's this journey, or travel, that breaks up the often abstract emotions and ideas present in art. A manner by which disparate and confusing parts can be made distinct, approachable, and memorable.

In the course of exploring myself, I often find overlaps between an inner world and my outer world. When this happens, my brain likes to cement that bond with a recurring theme, or a place I will often think of. These places are sometimes real with slight exaggeration, and sometimes fever dream abstractions with little seeds of truth. But one thing is always the same; I am always drawn back to these places and the ideas they present(ed) me with. So I decided to discuss a few of them here.

## Realism

Many of the landscapes that return to me are based in reality. They mirror real places I have been, or are true-to-life manifestations of those places and my memories within them.

### Tuscarora

Camp Tuscarora is a place I visited many times when I was younger. My father and I were involved in the Boy Scouts, and every summer there would be a week long trip to a large campgrounds known as Camp Tuscarora. Filled to the brim with the hills and mixed forests of New York, it's a time and place I remember fondly. Weeks of games and activities, the wonder of childhood in a place where rustic latrines, firepits, and burlap tents meet large scale mess halls, stone amphitheaters, and trading post slushie machines. The camp staff, the winding paths, the memories thick with adolescent emotions, all of it is eternally seared into my brain. I wrote a short vignette based on my time there, simply titled _Tuscarora_, which you can read [here](/writing/prose/2020/05/04/Tuscarora/).

### Library Tower

Library Tower, sometimes also referred to as Library Tower North in some of my work, is a tall building situated in the middle of the Binghamton University campus. Technically the physical space I refer to as Library Tower is the entirety of the Bartle Library building, including its many wings and towers, but my mind simplifies it to a single tower in my memories. Often I talk about this place from two perspectives: inside, and outside. Outside the tower I discuss the raging winds coming down off the high walls, the booming electronic bell sounds echoing from its peak, or the colored lights that sit around the lip of the roof. In this context, it takes the place of a symbol for the university, for my time there, the many phases of my mind that have come and gone in these years. Inside the tower is a more specific memory. A very concentrated dose of emotion from a very stressful time in my life, fueled mainly by a certain tough course I was taking. I made frequent trips to the library to meet with members of a project group I was involved in, and the "landscape" of that many-floored place still haunts me. The empty elevators, silent glass walls and doors, rows of racks of shelves of books. This aspect of Library Tower is talked about mostly in my piece "My Day", which appears in my collection of poetry [_Babylon Effect_](/writing/published/).

### Miscellaneous

There are many other memories from times and places that dot my writings, like the melancholic passages surrounding Port Crane and Virginia Beach, the nostalgic lines about Arnold Park and Carpathian Hill, and the multitude of abstractions based on the steep woodlands behind my house.

## Surrealism

Some of the landscapes that stick with me are not real places, but rather figments of my imagination that have such a bearing on my life that they stay rooted to me. These are often the places that make up the settings for my prose writing, or at least heavily inspire it.

### Stiletto (and Other Strange Negatives)

Stiletto, New York is a fictional city that acts like a mirror world to my hometown in the Greater Binghamton Area. It was conceived out of a string of dreams I had that all seemed to take place in a connected space. I decided on a whim that it was like a dream city, and I began to recognize many of the locations in those dreams as being surreal depictions of real places in my area. Everything had the feeling of being inverted or mirrored, like someone took an old Polaroid and flipped all the colors. That was how the name for _Strange Negatives_ came about, and it was this name and aesthetic idea that inspired a vast swathe of my work in the next year or two. You can see much of that work in _Babylon Effect_, as well as the series of images I made in [the gallery](/gallery/strange-negatives/) under the same name. Even now, Stiletto serves as inspiration for the short stories I write, which in my mind all take place in a single imaginary city filled with characters that are reflections of myself and those around me.

### Clover

The world of Clover is one that I'm still fleshing out, but I've had the seeds of this place in my mind for many years. It has no name, but has appeared in one way or another in many different creative writing projects that never saw the light of day. In many ways it's kind of an extension or offshoot of the alien world of "[Blood Firmament](/writing/prose/2020/06/09/Blood-Firmament-Part-One/)", but modified to be _slightly_ more familiar and earth-like. It draws from a lot of sci-fi inspiration coming from books, games, and other media, such as _The Left Hand of Darkness_, _Caves of Qud_, and more. I look forward to exploring this particular landscape further and finding out more about it.

After all the long-winded bullshit about art and emotion and how landscapes are personal to me and my thoughts on music, I really just wanted to take this time to discuss some ideas that are always swirling in my head. Much of what you just read describes my ethos when it comes to writing, and how I function as a human that takes in the world around him. Perhaps you find yourself in a similar position. Or perhaps you couldn't give less of a shit about my abstract and ridiculous tangents. But I got you to read this far, didn't I?

Let me know what you think about all of this. The music, the landscapes, all the pretentious bullshit in between, I want to hear about all of it. Send it my way at bsbuchanan99@gmail.com if you'd like.

Thanks for reading.
