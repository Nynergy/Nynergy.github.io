title: Horizon and Other Projects
meta: I talk about my latest programming project, among other pending ones.
---

I continue to let this website idle as I tend to other projects. I find that I'm constantly moving between different creative outlets, and at the moment I can't seem to focus on one long enough to feel like it makes a difference.
<br>

Well, except for one project in particular. Let's talk about _horizon_.

## Programming as a Means to an End
<br>

Over the past couple weeks, I've performed the age old task of any true programmer: steal ideas from other open source projects, tweak designs slightly, write it in a language you didn't intend to write it in at the start, and spew out as much lukewarm, half-alive code you can in as short a timeframe as possible.
<br>

Also, smile a bit, we like to have fun here.
<br>

You may remember me discussing the setup of my Logitech Music Server in [a previous blog post](/blog/2021/01/02/Running-Your-Own-Music-Server/).  Well, I found myself wanting some information about the currently playing track, so that I could display it in a polybar module. I found an interesting [Python library](https://github.com/roberteinhaus/lmsquery) that could communicate with the LMS and get that information, which eventually snowballed into [_horizon_](https://github.com/Nynergy/horizon).
<br>

<br>

_horizon_ is my attempt at reimplementing the functionality of the music server's browser-based interface, while incorporating a lot of design influences from projects like [ncmpcpp](https://github.com/ncmpcpp/ncmpcpp). Originally I wanted to make it in C++ so I could utilize my [vexes library](https://github.com/Nynergy/vexes), but I found that the lmsquery library was too important to abandon Python.
<br>

I'm still unsure of why I made _horizon_. I love to make terminal apps, and I love music, and getting to create a controller for my music server was certainly a joy, but why not just stick with the browser interface?
<br>

I don't know. Perhaps I was bored. Perhaps I simply used it as an excuse to ignore other projects that failed to interest me at the time. I'm still sitting on another edition of __Babylon Effect__, another Haskell program that may see the light of day eventually, five or six short stories and outlines of other prose passages that need writing/editing, and of course this website.
<br>

If programming is only a means to an end, then what is that end?
<br>

Regardless of how I see the completion of _horizon_ (at least this first release of it), I'm still very proud of what I made, and I use it almost every day. I use it far more than [_cascade_](https://github.com/Nynergy/cascade), which really tells you how much more I value music and creativity over pure productivity.
<br>

Feel free to check out _horizon_ if you also run an LMS, and let me know what you think.

## Programming as an End
<br>

I like to think that hobbies have no other purpose than to exist as themselves.  They are not a means to make some statement, or better someone's life, though they can be used in such a way if one wants. They exist for the sake of joy, and I've found in my life that joy itself _is_ the end.
<br>

I indulge in a number of hobbies, programming just being one of them. I also write poetry and prose, I make music, I play Netrunner. I do these things not because they better me as a person, or because they improve someone's life; I do these things because they bring me joy.
<br>

When it comes to programming, I am a hobbyist before I am a professional.
<br>

In that way, I suppose I like to view programming as an end in and of itself.  Why did I make _horizon_? Because I had to. It kind of feels more like a Zen koan in that sense.
<br>

## Ouroboros as Lifestyle
<br>

So where does that leave me and my many projects? Juggled amongst ourselves, never quite landing long enough to make significant progress. I put down current projects to pursue new ones that either die out unfinished or get put down to pursue newer ones. Old projects resurface in a bout of inspiration, boredom, stubbornness, or otherwise ill-conceived desire.
<br>

I've become accustomed to this type of life. Fluid-like, never settling on a spot to rest for long. But I feel if I want to derive greater joy from what I do, I need to learn the discipline necessary to finish what I start. I've got the precedent to do so; projects like _cascade_, _horizon_, [__Inner Weather__](https://benbuchanan.bandcamp.com/album/inner-weather), and my [three](https://www.amazon.com/Babylon-Effect-Ben-Buchanan/dp/1099453062) [poetry](https://www.amazon.com/Another-Flow-Ben-Buchanan/dp/B089M2HZ9S) [books](https://www.amazon.com/Drift-Illogical-Ben-Buchanan/dp/B092PG42QL) are all fruits of a finished labor.
<br>

What I'd like to do is write down all the different projects and ideas I've got rattling up in that brain of mine, toss out all the ones that I feel aren't feasible or interesting enough to fully pursue, and commit to finishing the rest, preferably with some kind of soft deadline.
<br>

Who knows, maybe it'll give you some more words to read on this site, and it'll give me something more to do than constantly come back to the same half-baked tail I keep eating.
