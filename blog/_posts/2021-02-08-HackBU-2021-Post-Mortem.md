title: HackBU 2021 Post-Mortem
meta: I go over the project I collaborated on for this year's HackBU Hackathon.

My third and final hackathon has come to an end, so I thought I would go over the project I helped make, as well as some thoughts on collaborative programming in general.

## The Project
<br>

This year I decided to work with a close friend of mine, one Mr. Nicholas Walling. Despite working together on numerous projects for various courses over the past four years, we had never collaborated on a hackathon project before, so I was looking forward to working with him. Right from the outset, we knew this wasn't going to be a very serious project, we wanted to have fun with it without becoming too engrossed or distracted by it to chat with other people at the hackathon, or to play games with other friends who were participating.
<br>

The hackathon was online, over Discord, so we didn't have to worry about being too loud, or being in close proximity to other people who were being noisy or distracting. It was very casual, though that's not to say my other hackathon experiences have been particularly pompous, pretentious, or professional. It's a fun time all around.
<br>

One of the categories we could submit our hack to was "Best UI", which immediately caught both of our eyes as ~~experienced~~ amateur web developers with ~~numerous~~ a couple web applications already under our belts for clients.  With that in mind, we set out to create a kind of "dashboard" interface someone might use to organize and manage various applications, control panels, cloud storages, etc. We decided we also wanted to add some analytics capabilities to the main page, so users could monitor various things about their applications right from the home screen.
<br>

You can see a screenshot of the "final product" below. It doesn't have any real functionality outside of the "Run Analytics" buttons, which present different sets of information for different apps in the panel on the right. But it sure looks fancy, which was our aim when designing the dashboard.

## The Results
<br>

Did we submit a winning hack for "Best UI"? Hell no, other people are actually competent at UI design and had far better entries that deserved to win. But we had fun.

## On Collaborative Programming
<br>

In the past, I've only had one other "real-time" collaborative programming session, and that was my first hackathon at HackBU during my sophomore year. I worked in a group of four on another front-end design project, this time using a sponsor's health paper database API to call up articles based on a user's search queries. But other than that, all my team-based projects have been for classes, and have required little to no communication outside of emails, texts, and the odd phone call. Nothing much in-person (or in this case, in a Discord voice call).
<br>

But this year it was just me and Nick in Discord, banging away at the keyboards of our laptops late into the night. Sometimes we would pop into a different channel where people were watching one of the organizers stream Minecraft, or just chat with friends and other participants. It was a very easy-going, stress-free kind of programming which I don't often get to enjoy. My own personal projects are free of stress for the most part, but there isn't that element of comaraderie you get with collaborative programming, especially in the context of a 24-hour coding event.
<br>

Overall, I enjoyed getting to connect with people in the middle of the pandemic, these people I haven't seen or spoken to in almost a year, though it feels much longer. If you're out there and you're interested in participating in an event like HackBU, do some investigating with your local schools or major universities in your area. They may be holding similar events, or other programming-based events.
<br>

Programming is a passion like any other, and like any other passion, doing it with those you care about is the ultimate privilege.
