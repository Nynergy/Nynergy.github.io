title: New Beginnings
meta: Lexica Chromatica gets yet another overhaul.
---

Once again, after eons of ignoring this site, I've returned to obliterate what
once was and replace it with something simpler, quieter, and easier to maintain.

Hopefully it also encourages me to actually post more content in the near
future.

As the blurb on the homepage now says, this is primarily a repository where I
will store links and information about various creative projects I am working
on. This can be music, writing, artwork, programming, or anything else that
strikes my fancy. This blog is really just a place to put random thoughts and
wanderings that I may want to return to at a later date.

As this is a site hosted on GitHub pages, you're more than welcome to go back to
earlier commits and read through the old archived content from previous
iterations of Lexica Chromatica. But for now, I'm happy to let it fall away, and
start with a clean slate.

I hope you come to enjoy what I do with this site in the future.
