For years now, I've been meaning to make a website to host all manner of personal projects. Poetry, creative writing, blog posts, music, images, and more. I did some research into self-hosting, but it seemed to be too much trouble and work - and I am already endlessly lazy. I learned about hosting a static website through GitHub using GitHub Pages, and thus __Lexica Chromatica__ was born.

This site serves as an archive or inventory of personal projects and other general topics I care to post about. You can find my poetry, as well as links to purchase/read anything I've published. Lately I've been diving more into the realm of prose writing, so those small projects will also appear on their own page. I will sometimes write up blog posts like this one, or posts concerning albums I like or have been into recently. I may also post some rankings of my personal favorite albums whenever I update that list. My own music can be found at the links on the music page, and that may also be where I post any album write-ups in the future. I have plans to add a gallery as well, since I do dabble in a bit of amateur digital artwork, usually centered around color and collage.

As you can see, I have many plans for this website, and I intend to fill it with whatever strikes my fancy. I hope you come to appreciate its contents in time.

To describe myself, I'd say I'm a creative at heart, leaning mostly toward abstract expressionistic writing. I love music, I work part-time in a grocery store, and I do some programming from time to time as well. I'm an undergraduate Computer Science student, so most of my programming is for school, but I enjoy making little tools and scripts and terminal applications when I have a moment. During times like these in the summer is when I usually immerse myself in my creative passions, and being stuck in quarantine has definitely left me with even more time on my hands. I've got plans for another album, a novel, and a terminal-based RPG. I've even got a proof copy of my newest collection of poetry that I've been editing (_shh, it's a secret!_).

In time, a more complete image of myself will manifest from these projects, like fragments of a mirror. If you find yourself interested in anything I have going on here at Lexica Chromatica, don't be afraid to let me know. Shoot me an email over at bsbuchanan99@gmail.com and I'll try to get back to you in a timely manner - no promises on my expediency though. I am a lazy man, after all.

Thanks for reading. Here's to more long-winded bullshit.
