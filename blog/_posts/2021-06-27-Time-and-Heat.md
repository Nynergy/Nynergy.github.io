title: Time and Heat
meta: I talk about recent happenings, projects, and other thoughts.

It's been quite a while since I last posted anything to the main site. Since then, I've been busy adding some extra new content, writing, making music, and trying to be an adult with a full time job. Time for a rousing session of ___What Bullshit is This Guy Gonna Regale Us With This Time!___

## Music
<br>

I've mentioned it in other places on the site, but I've been playing around with modular synthesis and making some demos and ideas for another ambient electronic album. I don't know if that will be finished any time soon, but I'm liking the progress so far. I may post some of the demos to the site in the future if I feel happy enough with them.

## Being a Productive Member of Society
<br>

So I've got a full time job now! I'm a developer for the IT group on campus at my alma mater. Oh yeah, did I mention I graduated? Funny, that. I'll be attending grad school in the fall part time while I work on campus, so it doesn't really feel that special quite yet.
<br>

Working a full week is nice for the more rigid schedule, as I feel my schedule has been a bit too fluid and aimless during quarantine. Time slips by without realizing, and I tend not to leave the house unless I have to go somewhere for work. As a result, I'm ~~slowly but surely regressing into~~ a shut-in teleworker with no social life.
<br>

Quarantine has really affected how I feel about myself and my work, both professionally and personally. I've become lazy and filled with doubt about the worth of my creative projects, unsure of my own capability to continue making something with meaning. Professionally, even though I've landed the full time position I wanted, I still feel like I haven't proven myself as a developer. A part of me understands that I will always be plagued by that feeling of inadequacy, so I want to look past it and just focus on my work. Hopefully that won't be too difficult a task, especially once we move back into offices and I don't have to work from the same room I live in.

## Thoughts (Quickly Melting)
<br>

It's very hot today, even after the sun has set. Or rather I should say, it's far too _humid_ in my room without any A/C. Only a cheap floor fan I have stood up on a chair in front of my half-open window.
<br>

I've always found it so strange how my feelings on seasons have changed over time, and even within each year. During the winter, I hate the cold and wish for summer to clear away the drab gray skies. During the summer, I dread the humidity and crave even a small cool breeze. When you're a kid you love summer, because it's the only vacation you really get. But now as an "adult" (whatever that means), I don't get vacations. Only the heat. Heat and time slipping like melted ice.
<br>

The older I get, the more I prefer spring and fall.
<br>

Summer used to be the most creatively rich time of my life. Vacation was my time to experiment with mediums, throw caution to the wind, make whatever struck my fancy. Now I feel like I sometimes need to drag the words out of myself, force motivation out of nothing. I guess that's why I so desperately want to get back into writing, and add more posts to the site. I want to return to some part of myself that I left behind before quarantine.
<br>

Perhaps that's the sentiment at the core of my recent poems, which I seem to be writing less and less frequently these days, especially after publishing __Drift Illogical__. Feel free to read my latest piece [here](/writing/poetry/2021/06/27/All-Ive-Left-Is-All-I-Have).

<br>

That's all I really have to say today. Nothing of any real consequence, it feels. But it's words on the site nonetheless. Something to cut my teeth on as I get back into the swing of things. Let me know what you think, if you please.
