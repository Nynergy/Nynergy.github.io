title: On Expectations and Burnout
meta: On my recent struggles with creative output.
---

Lately I've found that creating something meaningful is difficult for me.
<br>

That is to say, I've found myself spending hours staring at a blank vim buffer, nothing coming to mind. My fingers don't know what to type. I'll close and reopen the editor again and again, running meaningless commands just to keep myself from remaining completely motionless at the keyboard.
<br>

It's not necessarily a case of writer's block. I don't tend to suffer from a block like that very often, though it does happen. Instead, I feel like I've been going through a bout of creative burnout. This is quite common for me, although it feels different in this case, and I think I know why.
<br>

I've begun to expect things from myself. This doesn't seem all that sinister at first glance. Surely holding oneself to a certain standard comes with its benefits. However, I was never one to expect greatness or any certain standard from myself, let alone my work.
<br>

My writing, as well as my other creative outlets, have always been a reflection of a state, a place of being. Like a snapshot of my life at a point in time. Creating was simple, it came naturally. I experienced life, and drew from those experiences and my reactions to them in order to explore and populate this inner world of creative ideas. To better understand myself and all the little pieces that comprise me.
<br>

My work has always had this kind of flow to it; to experience first, and then to draw from it. Take in, and then push out. _This is the process_, as I've said in some previous writing. But lately, and especially after finishing up the initial draft of "[Captain Sunflower](/writing/prose/2020/07/06/Captain-Sunflower/)", I've been relying on lightning to strike twice in the same place. I mentioned in the preamble to that post that it was "drawn together from various fever dreams", which isn't entirely a pretentious notion. I didn't have fever dreams, but the ideas and compelling narrative points of that story kept me up at night. They would come to me suddenly and I would let them stew for a short time, then write more of the story, one section at a time. Originally, it was called "Lost at Sea" and I had no notion of that little girl who would go on to become the namesake of the story. It was a string of disconnected ideas that I modified until they fit into the narrative, however strangely or awkwardly.
<br>

But after finishing it, I felt drained. Much like the burnout I mentioned before, this is not an uncommon thing for me. But the pride I felt over that story began to change how I approached writing. Since then, I've been coming to the keyboard before I have anything to say, hoping something will come out. But there's nothing. What experience could I draw from? The isolation of quarantine is all I feel. Not even the pressures of being an essential worker have driven me to express anything but the sparse, abstract phrases that litter my recent poems and short prose ideas. Nothing as dense and sprawling as the poetry in _Another Flow_, or as long form and evolving as "Captain Sunflower".
<br>

I'm realizing now that I've been approaching this the wrong way. Creation is and always has been this well-defined _process_ I commit to, and I can't flip that process on its head and expect the same results.
<br>

Expectations are a killer when it comes to creative drive and inspiration. The next thing I write will not be another fever dream opus, or fleshed out collection of poetic motifs; it will be a small outline, or off-hand poem. Someone like myself can't just open up a vim buffer and expect something enlightened to come pouring out of my fingers, so I have to get out of that habit.
<br>

For the moment, I feel there's too much swirling around in my head, too many ideas, and not an ounce of motivation to make any of them a reality. The only thing that expecting greatness from them and wishing them into existence will birth is an endless frustration leading in circles of laziness and disappointment. Things on the site may slow down a bit as I begin to stockpile motivation and experience.
<br>

TL;DR - Brain no work good, this is all I got. More coming eventually, probably.
<br>

Thanks for listening to more long-winded bullshit, it's much appreciated.
