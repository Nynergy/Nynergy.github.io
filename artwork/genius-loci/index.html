    Genius Loci is a term that refers to the "spirit of a place". In modern
    Western interpretation, the atmosphere of a location. These nine pieces
    reflect various spirits or atmospheres created through the layering and
    compounding of simple images. Most are wallpapers, or other color-rich
    images manipulated until they emulated a foggy, watercolor-esque texture. A
    slew of pictures I grabbed from the Internet, or have used as desktop
    wallpapers in the past. Each piece has an ethereal feel, swimming in colors
    and shapes, drawing the viewer's eyes throughout with strange
    pseudo-perspective.

    These are places that exist all at once and not at all. Everywhere you are
    and aren't, and nowhere you know or have never heard of. These places are
    silly little reflections of many lives and no one to live them. I hope you
    enjoy them.
