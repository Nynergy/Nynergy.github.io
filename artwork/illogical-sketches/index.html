    <strong>Illogical Sketches</strong>
    <p>
    Illogical Sketches is a small collection of physical sketches I made while
    putting together the manuscript for my third volume of poetry, 'Drift
    Illogical'. The sketches are pen/pencil on watercolor paper, and were made
    with the aid of a ruler for straight lines and edges.

    Rather than trying to experiment with color or digital manipulation in
    order to evoke any particular feeling, I let my quarantine-addled
    imagination conjure up whatever aimless and illogical things it wanted to.
    The results were particularly geometric, sometimes unsettling, sometimes
    beautiful.

    <p>
    These pieces were eventually included as artwork in the final published
    version of 'Drift Illogical'.
