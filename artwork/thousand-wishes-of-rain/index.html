    Thousand Wishes of Rain was created during the recording of my album of the
    same name. It uses many of the same techniques that I used for my other
    collection, Genius Loci, but this time favors more noise and use of color
    as a mix of acrylic/watercolor textures. The images are inspired by nature,
    personal growth, and the falling rain.

    Not much else to say, really. There isn't some artistic shtick or narrative
    here. Just some ideas inspired by my music and the world around me, put
    into shapes and colors.
