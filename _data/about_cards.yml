      I'm a full-time code monkey. I create and maintain web applications, REST
      APIs, database queries, and other general scripting jobs.
    - >
      In my spare time I occasionally work on personal projects (like this
      website!) that I host on Github. I tend to focus on terminal applications
      and other fun little scripts.

# Musician

      I've been making music since 2018, typically in the realms of
      electronic/ambient music. More recently, I've been exploring the world of
      modular synthesis with VCV Rack.
    - >
      You can find my music scattered across a few different Bandcamp pages,
      but most of my music is under my own name. I also have a YouTube channel
      where you can listen to all my weird electronic noises with your eyeballs
      instead of your ears.

      I've been writing poetry and prose since around 2014, and I've
      self-published a number of collections of my original poetry to date.
      I've somehow even managed to get included in an undergraduate literary
      magazine at one point.

      You can find free PDF downloads of my books on this site. Go ahead and
      grab 'em, I don't mind.

      Maybe I'll read it. Maybe I'll reply. I promise I won't bite.
