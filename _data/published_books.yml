      <strong>Babylon Effect</strong> (originally published in 2019) was my
      first collection of original poetry. The pieces tend to be abstract,
      expressionistic, and littered with imagery and emotions inspired by
      nature and various dreams I was having at the time.
    - >
      The second edition (published in 2021) features updated styling to
      compliment the design of other collections, as well as added content --
      including pieces never published in my other collections.

      <strong>Another Flow</strong> was my second volume of original poetry.
      The pieces in this collection are similarly abstract to those in
      <strong>Babylon Effect</strong>, but I also tried to experiment with a
      more concrete style. Many poems are physically shaped and typeset on the
      page in a particular way, in order to evoke some kind of imagery in the
      reader.

      This volume also features an extensive set of appendices, including some
      collaborative work between myself and Ashley Markowicz,
      deconstructed/blackout poetry, and collage poetry.

      <strong>Drift Illogical</strong> was my third collection of original
      poetry, and serves as a capstone to my initial "trilogy" of volumes. It
      was released during the COVID-19 pandemic, and serves as a sort of view
      into my headspace during the first year or so of that time.

      The pieces are arranged in such a way as to put across the idea of
      "aimless time", or the feeling of time slipping by, elastic-like. Days
      going by in a haze of isolation. I cling to landscapes and other natural
      imagery, in order to offset the solitude of the pandemic, and as a
      result, this collection feels like my most introspective, emotionally
      resonant one to date.
