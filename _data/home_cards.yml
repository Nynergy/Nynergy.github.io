      I've made music under a few different names, scattered across a number
      of Bandcamp pages. Most of my work consists of ambient, electronic,
      noise, drone, and generative music.

      I've also got a YouTube channel where I post VCV Rack patches, album
      streams, audio visualizers, and whatever else strikes my fancy.

# Writing Card
- type: writing

      I've written poetry and prose for many years, far longer than I've been
      making music. My poetry typically focuses on abstract emotions, pulling a
      lot of imagery from nature and the environment, even dreams.
    - >
      Some of these pieces I felt were good enough to publish, and so I've
      edited, designed, typeset, and self-published a number of volumes through
      Amazon. Free PDF downloads of the collections are also available on the
      site.
