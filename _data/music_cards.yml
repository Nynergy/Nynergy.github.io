          <strong>Unknown Coordinates</strong>, and Maps of Low Fidelity in
          general, is my attempt at stripping back some of my sound, and
          focusing on natural, textural, calming songs.
        - >
          This style is very much inspired by the late Lindsheaven Virtual
          Plaza, specifically his <strong>Rainforest Hill</strong> series,
          which I adore and highly recommend.

          <strong>Inner Weather</strong> was the first album where I
          experimented with modular synthesis using VCV Rack. I incorporated
          samples, hooked up my cheap MIDI controller, and threw compositional
          ideas at the wall until something stuck.
        - >
          What I came away with was this collection of ambient electronic
          pieces focusing on sample manipulation with granular synthesis, as
          well as textural experimentation.
        - >
          Despite some of the lackluster production and performances, I'm still
          quite proud of what I made on this project. It made me fall in love
          with modular, and in the process I felt I could construct very fluid,
          emotive songs that fit into my abstract creative process.

          <strong>Icarian Sea</strong> is a small collection of tracks that
          dabble more in the worlds of noise and generative music. I try to
          maintain a balance and juxtaposition of abrasive, textural drones
          against serene, almost placid soundscapes.

          <strong>A Dream of Shapes Returning</strong> was my first published
          album, and it features some very crunchy, lo-fi homemade tape loops.

          <strong>This Isolation is in My DNA</strong>, and Neuromelter as a
          whole, was kind of a failed experiment. At the time I had wanted to
          try my hand at a more direct, abrasive, hardcore electronic sound,
          but ended up bleeding into the melodic ambient realm much of the
          time.
        - >
          While there are some interesting ideas present, I haven't touched
          Neuromelter in years, and don't plan to come back to it anytime soon.
