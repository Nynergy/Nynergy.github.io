          <strong>Sketches in Parallax</strong> is my latest batch of ambient/electronic modular synth tracks. The album is over 3 hours long, broken down into 4 discs across 27 tracks. It's an ambitious project, and I'm very proud of it.
        - >
          This time around I experimented more with noise, sample manipulation, and generative composition. As a rule of thumb, I tried not to interact with the patch while it was playing, except in very minimal cases. The result is a long series of rough sketches that feel like meditations on life, nature, and existence.

          <strong>Icarian Sea</strong> is a small collection of tracks that
          dabble more in the worlds of noise and generative music. I try to
          maintain a balance and juxtaposition of abrasive, textural drones
          against serene, almost placid soundscapes.

          <strong>Inner Weather</strong> was the first album where I
          experimented with modular synthesis using VCV Rack. I incorporated
          samples, hooked up my cheap MIDI controller, and threw compositional
          ideas at the wall until something stuck.

          <strong>A Dream of Shapes Returning</strong> was my first published
          album, and it features some very crunchy, lo-fi homemade tape loops.

          <strong>Unknown Coordinates</strong>, and Maps of Low Fidelity in
          general, is my attempt at stripping back some of my sound, and
          focusing on natural, textural, calming songs.
        - >
          This style is very much inspired by the late Lindsheaven Virtual
          Plaza, specifically his <strong>Rainforest Hill</strong> series,
          which I adore and highly recommend.
