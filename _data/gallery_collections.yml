      Back in the spring of 2019, I got into making little digital edits of
      pictures in GIMP. It was largely inspired by ideas surrounding an album I
      was making at the time.  In the end, that project never came out, but all
      the images I made were still interesting to me. So, I compiled my
      favorites into this gallery, titled <strong>Strange Negatives</strong>.
    - >
      The images all capture people and places in the area where I live
      (excluding the two images named <strong>Atlantic Base to Heaven</strong>
      and <strong>Revelation Lights</strong>), and feature a variety of
      experiments in color composition, inversion, selective hue shifting, and
      more. Much of the work is based on ideas of digital memories, decay,
      simulations, and other cyber-dystopian themes.

# Genius Loci

      <strong>Genius Loci</strong> is a term that refers to the "spirit of a
      place". In modern Western interpretation, the <i>atmosphere</i> of a
      location. These nine pieces reflect various spirits or atmospheres
      created through the layering and compounding of simple images. Most are
      wallpapers, or other color-rich images manipulated until they emulated a
      foggy, watercolor-esque texture. A slew of pictures I grabbed from the
      Internet, or have used as desktop wallpapers in the past. Each piece has
      an ethereal feel, swimming in colors and shapes, drawing the viewer's
      eyes throughout with strange pseudo-perspective.

      These are places that exist all at once and not at all. Everywhere you
      are and aren't, and nowhere you know or have never heard of. These places
      are silly little reflections of many lives and no one to live them. I
      hope you enjoy them.

# Illogical Sketches

      <strong>Illogical Sketches</strong> is a small collection of physical
      sketches I made while putting together the manuscript for my third volume
      of poetry, <strong>Drift Illogical</strong>. The sketches are pen/pencil
      on watercolor paper, and were made with the aid of a ruler for straight
      lines and edges.

      Rather than trying to experiment with color or digital manipulation in
      order to evoke any particular feeling, I let my quarantine-addled
      imagination conjure up whatever aimless and illogical things it wanted
      to. The results were particularly geometric, sometimes unsettling,
      sometimes beautiful.
    - >
      These pieces were eventually included as artwork in the final published
      version of <strong>Drift Illogical</strong>.
