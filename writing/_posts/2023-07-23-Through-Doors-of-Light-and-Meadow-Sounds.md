meta: A poem about sharing a genuine self with others.

Sky opens doors of light<br>
Through clouds

Water falls in cups of plenty<br>
Feeding grass

The bugs and birds all hide away<br>
They hold a breath<br>
In tandem

Hold their hands in candy planters<br>
Dusting sticks<br>
And<br>
Fuzzy antlers

Mossy letters written by no one<br>
Write themselves<br>
A love poem

The rhyme a rhythm coming back<br>
To itself<br>
In a knowing<br>
State of<br>
Mindfulness

I want to be a thought of love<br>
In concert with<br>
The rest of<br>
Me

I want to be a floating bee<br>
Or the pollen<br>
On his legs

I want to be a feeling that<br>
You know you<br>
Know<br>
From sometime in<br>
The long ago

I want to come back<br>
To you<br>
In a strange<br>
Returning dream

Compelling you to make something<br>
That speaks to children<br>
In the hearts and minds<br>
Of folks like<br>
Me<br>
Who haven’t lost that yearning<br>
And still wish to slumber<br>
Wish to dream

I want to be the thing that is your art<br>
Before it’s finished<br>
Cooling off

In meadows packed with petals bright<br>
They twist and tangle<br>
They dance and fight<br>
In harmony of color<br>
And light

In meadows packed I want you there<br>
To lay with me<br>
To ask of me<br>
To share

I want to share<br>
This<br>
With you
