title: Towers
---

Sun rhythm humming
Burning bulbs hanging dripping dew
Like drooling spiders
Many eyes
<!--excerpt--><br>

Clouds all sunburnt bleeding light through
Like mesh
The crows drinking into their
Pitch dark feathers
Like plants
<br>

Sumac burning blooming maroon on the side of the state route
To Ithaca
Like crimson eyes towering over other
Wildflowers
<br>

There is our bed in the earth
Up high in the towers of nature
Or a natural dream
Sleeping beauties us we and you me
<br>

zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
<br>

Something of the light infects us
Our melting sorrow shrinks
Until tomorrow
Holding up the hope
Like Sisyphus
<br>

Sun bleed in rhythm
For a little while longer
As I sleep in
Your towers
