title: Towers
---

Sun rhythm humming
Burning bulbs hanging dripping dew
Like drooling spiders
Many eyes
<!--excerpt-->

Clouds all sunburnt bleeding light through
Like mesh
The crows drinking into their
Pitch dark feathers
Like plants

Sumac burning blooming maroon on the side of the state route
To Ithaca
Like crimson eyes towering over other
Wildflowers

There is our bed in the earth
Up high in the towers of nature
Or a natural dream
Sleeping beauties us we and you me

zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz

Something of the light infects us
Our melting sorrow shrinks
Until tomorrow
Holding up the hope
Like Sisyphus

Sun bleed in rhythm
For a little while longer
As I sleep in
Your towers
