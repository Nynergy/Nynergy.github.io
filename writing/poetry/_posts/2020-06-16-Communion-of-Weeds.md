title: Communion of Weeds
---

Stale air dreams rafting choppy summer nights
Beyond the lights of bell jar harbors
Those luminous eyes of wrath <!--excerpt-->
Scraping the sea for a mark
<br>

A floor fan propped up on a CD rack
Pulling languid oxygen through a window
Cracked a couple inches on the hinges
<br>

Spiral forms colliding galactic centers
Supermassive facets maligned bed partners
All those brassy leaves coming down
The trees in Belden
<br>

All the pointed fiends riding natureâ€™s death
Into my mouth
Like snow
<br>

Melt on my crucible kissing
The earth
<br>

Dust and light and transit lines
Curling around the spine of the city
Concrete glass brains storming sparking
Sending signals to the mothership
That alien phase you know
You know its face
Well enough
<br>

The guide of its eyes and the caverns of its
Vacuous questions
<br>

Fever dream speculations
Sweating out the suspicions
Through storms of attrition
And tempestuous drones
<br>

Through the mesh of my window screen
Sucking in the gleaming air
Black and filling with lightning bugs
Taking flight in the darkness
<br>

Remembering the weeds with their touch
Their gentle clutch
Holding your world which you stole
From them
Which they stole from the ether
<br>

And the ether stole from an understanding
Beyond our own
<br>

Beyond those luminous eyes of humans
Breathing and wondering
In the thick summer air
