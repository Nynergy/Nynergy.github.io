title: All I've Left (Is All I Have)
---

I statue-ize myself
In a hand-me-down office chair
In the place where I sleep <!--excerpt-->
In the place where I tumble sleepless
In the place where I leap
Crumbling mirage platforms
To and fro and to again
<br>

I recognize myself
In the mirror dripping glass
Of summer through the window
Screen to backyard hill rise
Over humid wave melt horizon
<br>

The trees all stood still in the
Sun-slaked air
<br>

I memorize myself
Schematic reams and stacks
Tipping toppled over
June bug flutter heat splash
And ripping torn asunder
All the fragments
Drift
<br>

And all I’ve left
Of myself
All I’ve left
<br>

Is all I have
Is all I had
<br>

In blacktop simmer ripple pools
Popped like bubbles
I still myself and
Return
