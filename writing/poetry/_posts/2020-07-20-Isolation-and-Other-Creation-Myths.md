title: Isolation and Other Creation Myths
---

Sun pulling tree needle sheets over
A tired head
For sleep
<!--excerpt--><br>

The lazy string lights dark and unpowered
Before a wall of flitting birds and bugs
Soft velvet noises emanating
Their beaks and
Mandibles
Buzzing with words I want
To understand
<br>

My fingers striking the keyboard
Like driftwood over an ocean of endless
Frustration
Repeatedly giving way
To progress
<br>

Tiny motes of light speeding by
Circuits and locks and latches
Flipping and spinning and burning
So many thousand universes of stars and other
Flickering fires under my fingers
<br>

And so small the sounds they make
Against any noise
At all
<br>

The tinny echoes dropping
Into the canyons of self
I am carving
In books and certain soaking pages
<br>

<br>

If a tree falls in the forest,
But nobody is around to hear it,
Does it make a sound?
