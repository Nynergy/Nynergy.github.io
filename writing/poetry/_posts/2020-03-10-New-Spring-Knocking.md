title: New Spring Knocking
---

Freeway sounds
Cruising by the empty strip mall lots
Under the overpass and
Over the underpass <!--excerpt-->
And passing the time under the open sea
Floating over the microbiomes
Like streets and houses in water
Under tides and earthquake bunkers
<br>

Empty fields and retaining walls
Tohoku matter slowly regrowing
In terrapin turns and memories
<br>

Terrarium heaving against the glass
Breathing mass green and gold and old
And waiting since time starting spinning out from the center
From the heated cocoon of origin
Into the cold reaches
Colder seasons
Reaching out from dead dying trees
In yellow green buds
Blooming
<br>

Blooming
Again
<br>

Like
Before
<br>

In pearlescent strings along the wires
Streamers steaming pavement weavers
Stars and other alignment wavers
Flapping banners blackness sheens
And pointillist dreams
In new magic beams
<br>

Coming
Down
<br>

Sun driving posts of light
Into the soil
<br>

We can climb
Up
<br>
