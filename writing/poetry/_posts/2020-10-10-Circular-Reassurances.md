title: Circular Reassurances
---

going round in circles
phantom smiling ghosts chase us
going round our heads
like comets
<!--excerpt-->

in our attempts to comprehend
time
it slips by
in the curved space
around your gravity arms
those forms without force
or speed

chasing comet trails
what else are we here to do?

going round in circles
tree rings chanting from within
bark shawls
crawling with small insects
lost and getting
cold

cold sheets we sweat in and under
like bridges
and other armatures of suspension
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of&nbsp;disbelief

going round in circles
like the same dream you've had
for so many years now
reaching out for that
brass ring

my ring's losing most of its finish
slowly turning silver
a snowy silver howling round my finger
hollow winds of time
gliding by

all the trees brittle
all the grass splitting apart
all the world in a bronze stupor
before a white frigid heart

%%%

warm core glowing
out frosted glass
faces
in watery windows
or gazing from
odd verandas

eyes flaming
where do they find that blaze?

those spirits and phantoms who
grasped at things I dream of
and did not come away
empty handed

%%%

going round in circles
stars swinging in the whim
like censers

their wills shining down
on the fraying leaves
on my fraying sleeves
they gleam

and it's gone from me
my hands are empty
they're burned out
they're burned clean

i've nothing left to say
sometimes

%%%

summer morning after dawn
when the tree still clung
to dew like gems

hidden noises behind the house
playing birds and deer and
the children we once were

spring breathing gold
down our necks like we'd
bathed with the gods

and in our innocence we
picked flowers
for our mother
