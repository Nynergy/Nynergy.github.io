title: Circular Reassurances
---

going round in circles
phantom smiling ghosts chase us
going round our heads
like comets
<!--excerpt--><br>

in our attempts to comprehend
time
it slips by
in the curved space
around your gravity arms
those forms without force
or speed
<br>

chasing comet trails
what else are we here to do?
<br>

going round in circles
tree rings chanting from within
bark shawls
crawling with small insects
lost and getting
cold
<br>

cold sheets we sweat in and under
like bridges
and other armatures of suspension
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of&nbsp;disbelief
<br>

going round in circles
like the same dream you've had
for so many years now
reaching out for that
brass ring
<br>

my ring's losing most of its finish
slowly turning silver
a snowy silver howling round my finger
hollow winds of time
gliding by
<br>

all the trees brittle
all the grass splitting apart
all the world in a bronze stupor
before a white frigid heart
<br>

%%%
<br>

warm core glowing
out frosted glass
faces
in watery windows
or gazing from
odd verandas
<br>

eyes flaming
where do they find that blaze?
<br>

those spirits and phantoms who
grasped at things I dream of
and did not come away
empty handed
<br>

%%%
<br>

going round in circles
stars swinging in the whim
like censers
<br>

their wills shining down
on the fraying leaves
on my fraying sleeves
they gleam
<br>

and it's gone from me
my hands are empty
they're burned out
they're burned clean
<br>

i've nothing left to say
sometimes
<br>

%%%
<br>

summer morning after dawn
when the tree still clung
to dew like gems
<br>

hidden noises behind the house
playing birds and deer and
the children we once were
<br>

spring breathing gold
down our necks like we'd
bathed with the gods
<br>

and in our innocence we
picked flowers
for our mother
