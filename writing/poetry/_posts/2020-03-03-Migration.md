title: Migration
---

The birds moving around poles of light streaming down
Searching rays scanning shores and radar bays bouncing signals <!--excerpt-->
Back and forth in pen pal signatures
The sealed and hidden questions moving through their secondaries

Where the dead yellow grass begins breathing
Softly again
That is the letter splayed naked with the words going down the throat of your mind
There in a new spring light

Along the mudflats and reed soaked marshes
Making little prints slowly subsumed by the caressing form of the wet earth
Small beady eyes watching migration routes
From cascading northern peaks to western ridges rolling in fields of dust and deserts
Cotton moving in patterns across the sky
While weeds whisper below of
Nests and sandbars and empty meadows beneath hanging garden lightfields at night

Looking up at platinum spatters
Through a memory of willow vines
Something moves around the grass blades
Towing solitary minds

And the moon pulls the Sun around in rose spirals
And it shines between the lines
