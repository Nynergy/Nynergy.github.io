Bloom, bloom, under the storm that
Flooded out the little birds
Fresh from eggs
Never seen
<!--excerpt-->

Burst, wild from corners and other
Solitary confinements
Padded with your
Excuses and
Forgetting

Frantically, freakishly, take in the fold
The cloth you know, you see
Around your ears and
Many faces

Resting, breathing, beneath the golden hour
Under the layer of night slowly
The layer of night
Slowly
Keep going
Breathing in
and out
and sometimes
otherwise

briefly, sidewinder noises whizzing by
speeding by dripping listening
to your dreams like
boiling fevers

listing, empty houses, shuddering in the rain
vacant air playing making dances
in your hair
t h e :: s m e l l :: o f
j u n i p e r :: b e r r i e s

There is a silence in empty sanctuaries
All around

Do you hear it?

The rain sometimes comes over the garden
After I've already watered it

Do you find it funny?

I do

Nature is a thorough thing
Haphazard from every angle in spirals and beams
In patterns of salmon scales and clouds like whipped cream

A natural system of fullness and schemes
Like meandering streams
Into death

And then it all opens up again like a flower

Do you see it?
Do you see it like I do?

-=+=-

grow, merge with this being completely
for it was complete before
we came here

it knows we are here
with it
