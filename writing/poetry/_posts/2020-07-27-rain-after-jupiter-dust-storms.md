Bloom, bloom, under the storm that
Flooded out the little birds
Fresh from eggs
Never seen
<!--excerpt--><br>

Burst, wild from corners and other
Solitary confinements
Padded with your
Excuses and
Forgetting
<br>

Frantically, freakishly, take in the fold
The cloth you know, you see
Around your ears and
Many faces
<br>

Resting, breathing, beneath the golden hour
Under the layer of night slowly
The layer of night
Slowly
Keep going
Breathing in
and out
and sometimes
otherwise
<br>

briefly, sidewinder noises whizzing by
speeding by dripping listening
to your dreams like
boiling fevers
<br>

listing, empty houses, shuddering in the rain
vacant air playing making dances
in your hair

<br>

There is a silence in empty sanctuaries
All around
<br>

Do you hear it?
<br>

The rain sometimes comes over the garden
After I've already watered it
<br>

Do you find it funny?
<br>

I do
<br>

Nature is a thorough thing
Haphazard from every angle in spirals and beams
In patterns of salmon scales and clouds like whipped cream
<br>

A natural system of fullness and schemes
Like meandering streams
Into death
<br>

And then it all opens up again like a flower
<br>

Do you see it?
Do you see it like I do?
<br>

<br>

grow, merge with this being completely
for it was complete before
we came here
<br>

it knows we are here
with it
