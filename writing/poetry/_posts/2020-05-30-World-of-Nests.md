title: World of Nests
---

Black streets fanning out
Ripples through the patches of trees
We keep
Between the brownstone blocks
On fire <!--excerpt-->
In heat
This bleeding body
We keep
Kicking around
<br>

The windows smashed
The cars upturned
The magazines emptied
Fueling anger as it burns
<br>

A quiet smile peeking through the clouds
Evaporated in TV cameras
Dulled in social media stories
In the night they stand on shaky legs
And bay at the moon
The white moon
Hovering over
Since time began
<br>

Gas canisters and rubber bullets
Litter the ground like birdseed
From government feeders
<br>

Wrappers and plastic reminders
Glass shards and sooty lots vacant
Under towering buildings still stood
Fortress-like defending the cowards
The ill-raised wielders of power
<br>

In their world of nests
Filled with eggs
Paper thin excuses
And
Ideologies
<br>

Between the green where we breathe
Growing beams of comfort we beam
Our teeth whiter than their eyes
Whiter than Deathâ€™s demise
<br>

We will grow plants above
This spinning planet
And make nests in the stars
Every ball and chain left
Far
Far
Behind
