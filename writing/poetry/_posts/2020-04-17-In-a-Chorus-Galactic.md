title: In a Chorus Galactic
---

Born dancing in ritual orbits
Around great pillars and beating heart anchors
Hands in arpeggiated waves blinking <!--excerpt-->
Eyes in alignment with a far off presence
Thousand yard stare
<br>

Golden doorway light stuck to the floor
Wrapped across the corner of the room
Sticky veneer
Jungle of stains and polish and glue
Brushing over all the organic shapes
With squares and microchip patterns
<br>

We are much better at closing than opening
Curling in to that great sheet
Folding in to that warmth craving company
We are much better at holding on than giving up
But only if it doesn’t get too
Cold
<br>

Out there
The ring of light around the empty space
Cities of DIY people
Stapled creased at the corners crimped and taut
Smiles acrylic and primer in the wrong
Order
<br>

Don’t go where you won’t return
Unless you don’t plan on
Coming back
<br>

Born dancing those ancient steps they all took before us
And we are clapping in circles
Shattering the air with our many layered voices
In a chorus galactic
Speaking in tongues of paths never taken
And when we come to that place we have never been before?
<br>

We multiply over the leaves like rain
And so many bugs making sheets of noise
In the pitch hot summer nights
Like a swarm of music boxes in a tar pit
<br>

Flashing our heaving heavy light over the trees
They don’t want to see our glass eyes
So far removed from that mother cloth
We were cut from
<br>

And we keep dancing in rooms and chambers
The same words coming out our mouths
Just with different letters
Strange science of impressionistic thought becoming lexical axioms
Making laws out of happenstance
<br>

Remember that we are ideas made
Tender flesh
Skin and stems and joints and petals
Curling in without that dance
<br>

Keep sprouting worlds from your trunk
Spreading far from where you were planted
