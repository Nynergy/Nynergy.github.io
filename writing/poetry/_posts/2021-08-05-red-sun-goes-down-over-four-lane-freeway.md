title: red sun goes down over four-lane freeway
---

atmospheric shimmer a few degrees above the horizon line
as i sit and breathe
and become somewhere else
in my long black sedan
<!--excerpt--><br>

the whine of my engine
like a child never grown
beyond an echo of my own
maturity
<br>

a scaffold of thought
like stones balanced
considering mutual identities with zen
and the uneasy bond of nothing with
eternity
<br>

snapped branch on the road
after a storm
what does it see
<br>

does it see
<br>

flare of a red sun like a ring world
hula-hoops my skull
like a time i once felt
and have thought about
maybe once or twice
or more
but no more
<br>

sunburned across my forehead
sunken into my empty vessel
every moment on a roulette wheel
spinning
<br>

that scaffold shudders
in a cold that is not there
but i am somewhere
<br>

at the movies in the summer
or the Cyber just before winter tightens
in the lens of a setting day
or the words of a closing chapter
<br>

in the water of a dream
that i clear from my throat
as the morning birds wipe my mind
as autumn drives closer to the center of this place
where we sleep with
each other
<br>

along the four-lane freeway
we set with the star
spinning down slower and slower
growing red and old
<br>

i sit in my long black sedan
and breathe the cold air of my a/c
and wonder
<br>

what will i do
before i wash away
