title: Like Routes

The lightning bugs left months ago
Your gossamer wake taking them out on
Straw rafts
<!--excerpt-->

The birds are quiet
But they are there
Softly existing next to you
Softly existing
Next to me

Gray dusks
Tallied in your head
Running off the space on the page
Remember the murky Susquehanna
Sliding under your childhood
Burning
Bridges with the handshakes and smiles
And plastic bags full of
Things

Those are so long gone now
Where did they go

Exist here softly next to
Me
In a quiet heat
It’s okay if you
Smother me
You’re a mother sun
Shining deep into plexiglass aviaries

Change with me
Share my cocoon
Surely I’ve left enough
Space
For a season
Or two

My mind is a dandelion seed cloud
In the spring wind

Hm, what’s that?
What are you talking about?
Forget that
Let’s spread our limbs like routes
And go
