title: The Girl With the Painted Eyes
---

Two red moons
In a thick mud dusk
Mostly darkness and
Humidity
<!--excerpt--><br>

The girl with the painted eyes
Like a moth’s wings
Sits and sees
With her antennae
As I drink my water
<br>

I am the room temperature
The critical mass of mist
The white noise of the fan
Spiral born black around my bed
<br>

She is the electric hum of the lamps
Ruby glow on a face she’s never seen
Or maybe never opened her eyes
To find
<br>

The heat wraps
Like a leather cocoon
And I drink my water
As she sees into me
<br>

And I sit in her space
Around like a ring
Meditate her
Between my splayed fingers
In a dance
<br>

I am the web caught in myself
And wonder if my eyes
Quickly closing
Are painted
Like hers
