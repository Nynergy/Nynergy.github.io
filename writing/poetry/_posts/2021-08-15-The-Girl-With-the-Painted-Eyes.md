title: The Girl With the Painted Eyes
---

Two red moons
In a thick mud dusk
Mostly darkness and
Humidity
<!--excerpt-->

The girl with the painted eyes
Like a moth’s wings
Sits and sees
With her antennae
As I drink my water

I am the room temperature
The critical mass of mist
The white noise of the fan
Spiral born black around my bed

She is the electric hum of the lamps
Ruby glow on a face she’s never seen
Or maybe never opened her eyes
To find

The heat wraps
Like a leather cocoon
And I drink my water
As she sees into me

And I sit in her space
Around like a ring
Meditate her
Between my splayed fingers
In a dance

I am the web caught in myself
And wonder if my eyes
Quickly closing
Are painted
Like hers
