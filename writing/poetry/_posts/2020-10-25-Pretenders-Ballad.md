pink pale morning

haven't seen the sun blush in seasons
passing like childhood
<!--excerpt-->

only a rumor or a dream
they used to tell us
we would have

we dream alone now
as we always have
all in our head

i don't want to dream
until i'm dead

just breathing out slow vapors
into the winter night

~~~\*
~~~~~~~~~~~~\*
~~~~~~\*

dragon's breath
we used to make believe
we used to think we were
in a fantasy

we used to play pretend
and some of us never stopped

we dreamed of a man in the moon
and the forgiveness of god
and we forgot how to wake up

we used to play in paradise
of innocent thoughts and
pink pale minds
our feet running miles in a moment
somewhere far off we could only
imagine

nobody there to count our footsteps
only the smile of every beautiful thing
looking back into our shouting glee

mouths wide open in joy

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\*
~~~~~~~~~\*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\*

life puts a muzzle on people like us

breathing smoke into sharp crystal shadows

and the leaves are all fleeing
skeleton trees
left behind like grave markers

and i sometimes ask myself
should we keep dreaming

of pink pale mornings
and fantasy skies

should we keep dreaming

until we die

~~~\*
~~~~~~~~~~~\*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\*

light falling on so many flowers
in a field of stars

the sun poking fun at our faces
and we smile back with warmth

in our eyes there is love
you cannot comprehend its meaning

a steady moving rhythm
cool rolling breeze

you pull at my sleeve for attention

we are not alone in this place

bright and fresh and fragile

like a string of petals

pale and pink and alive

awake
