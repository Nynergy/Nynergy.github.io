pink pale morning
<br>

haven't seen the sun blush in seasons
passing like childhood
<!--excerpt--><br>

only a rumor or a dream
they used to tell us
we would have
<br>

we dream alone now
as we always have
all in our head
<br>

i don't want to dream
until i'm dead
<br>

just breathing out slow vapors
into the winter night
<br>

~~~\*

<br>

dragon's breath
we used to make believe
we used to think we were
in a fantasy
<br>

we used to play pretend
and some of us never stopped
<br>

we dreamed of a man in the moon
and the forgiveness of god
and we forgot how to wake up
<br>

we used to play in paradise
of innocent thoughts and
pink pale minds
our feet running miles in a moment
somewhere far off we could only
imagine
<br>

nobody there to count our footsteps
only the smile of every beautiful thing
looking back into our shouting glee
<br>

mouths wide open in joy
<br>

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\*
~~~~~~~~~\*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\*
<br>

life puts a muzzle on people like us
<br>

breathing smoke into sharp crystal shadows
<br>

and the leaves are all fleeing
skeleton trees
left behind like grave markers
<br>

and i sometimes ask myself
should we keep dreaming
<br>

of pink pale mornings
and fantasy skies
<br>

should we keep dreaming
<br>

until we die
<br>

~~~\*

<br>

light falling on so many flowers
in a field of stars
<br>

the sun poking fun at our faces
and we smile back with warmth
<br>

in our eyes there is love
you cannot comprehend its meaning
<br>

a steady moving rhythm
cool rolling breeze
<br>

you pull at my sleeve for attention
<br>

we are not alone in this place
<br>

bright and fresh and fragile
<br>

like a string of petals
<br>

pale and pink and alive
<br>

awake
