stillness stillness
and scavenger rain
gone away again
<!--excerpt--><br>

the water's gone and
moonlight song
and singing lullabies
for sleep
<br>

but sleep avoids
and dances sunlight dawn
the yawning goes
and goes and goes
but not away
<br>

just awake
<br>

stillness stillness
moving wild
like beasts of mind put out
to pasture
and graze on the vine
<br>

i grow from my
brain
stem
stalk
<br>

the little seed of a
micro man
making micro
things growing
oh so slow into
micro beings
<br>

living color seams
like ravines in the world
showing stars in the black
stillness stillness
moving undulating
or maybe crawling climbing
your summit
your peak
<br>

your limit
<br>

stillness stillness
buzzing worlds
buzzards whirl
tasting futures
in your whorls
<br>

my fingers somnambulized
like spirits
drifting
and glowing eyes
in glassy rags and ties
<br>

i'm sleeping stillness
stillness sleeping
in my arms
a quiet leaping
up and
up and
up and
<br>

and
and
and
<br>

always something more
never
stillness
stillness
<br>

only drifting
drifting
in that bay
don't think that i've
forgotten
