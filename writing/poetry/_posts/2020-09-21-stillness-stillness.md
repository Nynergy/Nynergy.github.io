stillness stillness
and scavenger rain
gone away again
<!--excerpt-->

the water's gone and
moonlight song
and singing lullabies
for sleep

but sleep avoids
and dances sunlight dawn
the yawning goes
and goes and goes
but not away

just awake

stillness stillness
moving wild
like beasts of mind put out
to pasture
and graze on the vine

i grow from my
brain
stem
stalk

the little seed of a
micro man
making micro
things growing
oh so slow into
micro beings

living color seams
like ravines in the world
showing stars in the black
stillness stillness
moving undulating
or maybe crawling climbing
your summit
your peak

your limit

stillness stillness
buzzing worlds
buzzards whirl
tasting futures
in your whorls

my fingers somnambulized
like spirits
drifting
and glowing eyes
in glassy rags and ties

i'm sleeping stillness
stillness sleeping
in my arms
a quiet leaping
up and
up and
up and

and
and
and

always something more
never
stillness
stillness

only drifting
drifting
in that bay
don't think that i've
forgotten
