Your hand in the door
    Holding something open in the light
Shining beams through lenses
  Other worlds in slanted shapes and names <!--excerpt-->
Becoming the petals creeping peeking out
      Through the ice and stubborn
Mannerisms
<br>

That raining sunlight coming down
Remember me in angled colors
Do you remember me there?
Do you remember my shape?
<br>

Lanterns hanging swinging dripping warm
    Ideas down the slopes we made
Us kids beating down the grass
  Watching it bend back up slowly always
Watching is and learning is and
      We is there and then was gone
We can’t go back to that
 All our droning memories like sugar
A slurry in the sky dissolved
               As
                                  Clouds
<br>

Terrace steps along the coast
The amber wisps above the waves saying
Hello there good morning
Nice weather we’re having
<br>

Soft shells
Beating blood organs
Breathing in and out in a natural rhythm
You know this phase
Nature’s flock of time in feathers falling
On your face
In molting
<br>

Buzzing Sun and Humming Moon
    Holding hands back in September
Making rose fruition moves like dances
  On park benches in high heels
All barbs and leafy shadows
<br>

Holding hands back in
        Whenever
Where the door of light
Shining stratified along across the tides
Remembers shafts of foamy night
   It felt alright
 It was alright
It was
<br>

For a time
<br>

And all things are moving
Along
<br>

As they
<br>

                      Do
