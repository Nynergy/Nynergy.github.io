title: A Kiss from Stiletto
---

Lower lot in the middle of the woods. Quarantine ragers blasting lights and noise out into the night.<!--excerpt--> Post-time sleepwalking. Four pack of something heavy swinging from my right hand. High visibility jackets swarming across the blacktop. Cracks and shouts, people still walking toward the swirl. Through the metal husks driven by blind drivers. I turn and hurry under security footage rolling. Drop the liquid weight by my front right quarter panel. Back out and away from those faces I knew from before there was an after. I’ve got to leave without knowing why.
<br>

On the parkway under chromatic traffic signals. Steering emergencies through intersections. Past all the closed buildings. Piano tiles swimming through the shadows. Your memory is a series of hidden switches and strings. Pulling compartments open and entering the glass room. Messy desk. Bay window. Deciduous view.
<br>

Into an empty room. Single window. Olive paint. Trim carpet. Closed door. Thin glasses on your nose. Who are you?
<br>

Like I asked.
<br>

Lean into you. Nothing soulful. Taking what I wanted. Backing away. You’re gone already I am awake. I am still here curling around these dark empty lots in my dreams. Somewhere in Stiletto. I miss you in the way I miss nothing.
