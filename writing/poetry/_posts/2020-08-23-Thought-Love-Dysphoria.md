title: Thought Love (Dysphoria)
---

hollow core whispers skittering across the dust
to my fingertips fleeing some
quietness i cannot
extricate
<!--excerpt--><br>

labyrinth walls unstill
dancing carnations about my static position
wrapped around each limb
each an incision
filling up
<br>

== + ==
<br>

failing light in the empress seat
gaze down at me
down at me
in little marbles of joy
scatter along my shored mind
buried in brambles of love
reaching out for
someone
<br>

this time alone waving a hand in
goodbye but never leaving
<br>

returnal wave of teaching slowly
brushing fingers along my face
i know this fuzzy
feeling
like amber afternoons
<br>

== + ==
<br>

i do not know what it is to be sad
like they know
<br>

== + ==
<br>

strange wondering crane
perched on rocks and hard places
under my dim light
<br>

day breaks the river
flowing over smoothing her
and flying away
<br>

strange wandering crane
coming back to see my light
with a puzzle box
<br>

== + ==
<br>

luna moth
in porcelain hands
sleeping a peaceful dreaming away
away away
<br>

swift dark night sweeping us on
against chainlink fences
above a sea of crystal webs
pulsing
<br>

the world opened up
seeing the crease pattern
lines of her hand
grasping needing
some thing
<br>

== + ==
<br>

pond life on my mind
growing algae layers
simple organics
<br>

you cross my ripples
in a lazy gondola
<br>

i cannot bring my hand
to break your placidity
<br>

we sit and grow
spanish moss
and sumacs
