title: Jan's Dreams
---

Down at the end of the hall
Acrylic petals fall
Ing off the stems like au
Tumn shades or specters
<!--excerpt--><br>

Curled up fetal drying dying wait
Ing for Mother’s love mandate
Hands scooping up fragrant life
<br>

Dreams logician puzzles gleam
Like breams in water beam
Ing smiles back up into the sheen
Of light like solar skin thick layers keen
On tipsy tilted lovers seen
Together last remembering forever
<br>

Memories making webs of meaning
<br>

,;’,;’,;’,;’
<br>

Burnt golden frames in blazing luster
Wooded capsules rectangular clusters
And canvases in mustard
Boxes with painted prints and youngster
Desires in still life pining
<br>

Something older she trapped there
With stems and stamens and pistols for hair
In the wind lighter than whispers where
Whipping by thoughts of light are common
<br>

Is common
To believe in a dream you keep having
Keep giving
<br>

‘;,’;,’;,’;,
<br>

Grassy dew clinging dropping pianos
In early sun like your father’s and his father’s meandered
Remembering of time before they thought it mattered
They just hunt and gather
Early man woes
<br>

Clay pots and soil brimming
Grinning through the green beginning
To poke through the base bringing
A smile to her spirit
<br>

And her specter hands drift over the canvas
As she whispers a petal unfurling
