title: Vermiculate Man
---

Tessellations reorganizing mirror worlds
At the edges sewn with pine needles <!--excerpt-->
Wisps of misty eyes in the center of
Clouds in the rye waving ritual dances
Like movers and shakers

The oceanic plates and tides behind me
Washing around the barnacle struts and buoys
Slick ropes like orchestral shows
So far behind me
So far now

A blackening desert before me
The Sun a helicopter hovering
Murky pond of the sky moving in molasses rivulets
Your flowers just the scent of my mind
I do still remember
I do

Chart my prints
Map my voice from the time streams I came from
All the way to this corner of my galaxy
Forming of melted glass casted in sleep
Nocturnal cranium crucible

Cast your rays from behind the whirring blades of the Sun
Beyond the cockpit coming down
Take up my noises in your wind and scatter them across the dirt of the planet
Carry my dreams in their cryptic skins and trace the vermiculate patterns of their surface
I am doing all this for you
I am

Through the sand beyond the mountain ridges
And back to the sleeping cities in gray and white
Drink our tranquility light
Deep into the night
Collecting fires like brush chandeliers

Come douse me
I will wait here for your liquid spirit
I will
