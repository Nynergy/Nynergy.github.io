title: Reflections on Labor and Age
---

Paper people folding feet across the miles
Tiled and rough with facsimile stone
Pushing dripping carts in a storm of
Fear and ages of denial
<!--excerpt-->

Fighting nothing but themselves and the people
They remember themselves being
Some time
Ago

It was
Only a
Moment
...

A sheet pulled across the face in the
Endless plexiglass reflections
Down rows of register lanes under lights
Decades after installation

Receipts left empty or tossed in a blue bin
Softly curling and waiting
But no one will
Read them anymore

Do those walking memories remember their amounts?
Do they know the tax or the thinning discounts?

Right next to the thought of a sunny day
On 5th Avenue,
Or the country of another name

A repeater of lullabies from mothers
Who died so many years ago
It’s a miracle these memories are alive
Still themselves

Shuffling limping behind stout carts with only
A half gallon of milk, a half loaf of rye bread,
And half a newspaper with
Half the words in red

.      .      .

We are only moving forward here
Never backward
Never still
Only ahead

Under lights and masks we are moving ahead
Before we can get our wits about us

Time is leaving us like a trail
We are sometimes not the feet but only the
Prints left behind
Sometimes

Shuffling days we remember like murals
No one else can ever see
