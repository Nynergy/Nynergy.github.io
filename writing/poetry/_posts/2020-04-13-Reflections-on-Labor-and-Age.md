title: Reflections on Labor and Age
---

Paper people folding feet across the miles
Tiled and rough with facsimile stone
Pushing dripping carts in a storm of
Fear and ages of denial
<!--excerpt--><br>

Fighting nothing but themselves and the people
They remember themselves being
Some time
Ago
<br>

It was
Only a
Moment
...
<br>

A sheet pulled across the face in the
Endless plexiglass reflections
Down rows of register lanes under lights
Decades after installation
<br>

Receipts left empty or tossed in a blue bin
Softly curling and waiting
But no one will
Read them anymore
<br>

Do those walking memories remember their amounts?
Do they know the tax or the thinning discounts?
<br>

Right next to the thought of a sunny day
On 5th Avenue,
Or the country of another name
<br>

A repeater of lullabies from mothers
Who died so many years ago
It’s a miracle these memories are alive
Still themselves
<br>

Shuffling limping behind stout carts with only
A half gallon of milk, a half loaf of rye bread,
And half a newspaper with
Half the words in red
<br>

.      .      .
<br>

We are only moving forward here
Never backward
Never still
Only ahead
<br>

Under lights and masks we are moving ahead
Before we can get our wits about us
<br>

Time is leaving us like a trail
We are sometimes not the feet but only the
Prints left behind
Sometimes
<br>

Shuffling days we remember like murals
No one else can ever see
