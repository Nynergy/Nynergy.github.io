title: I Wrote This Outside the Wegmans I Work At
---

We’re all caught in the flaring tendrils of uncertainty
Under the blaring PA of holding calls and summons <!--excerpt-->
The belts turning around the rollers, the vacuums whirring
The guiding spirits posted at the corners in gold trimming

It snowed a couple days ago
Some patches of the lawn are still white
It’s May 10th today
Mother’s Day

The birds are talkative in the morning
I wish I could eavesdrop on their conversations
Like a small stream winding underneath their
Ancient syllables
Taking in the plosives, the formants, the canyons of tone
In a time of growth

Something is blowing across the parking lot
But there is no breeze
A visiting mystery walking a dog
A line of cars waiting for the drive up service
A list of people who didn’t get their flowers today

We ran out last night

Such a strange concept
To run out of flowers

The tree not 20 feet away is still
Blooming

How silly
