title: Looming Trees Dreaming Night
---

Staring motion sensor offline
Silent windchill negative
The day in a box with ribbons
Clear blue top
Amber shadows dancing cannot stop
<!--excerpt--><br>

Holding hands with chickadee memoirs
Little branches children reaching out
Perched and ready
Listening in sunrays
Making eyes at glass reflections hoping for a return
Some days
<br>

Humming footbridge tunes
The water underneath gentle strumming
Taking our force out
And floating on
And on
<br>

Our words making divots scoring lines
What I meant back then
Means nothing now
And what Iâ€™d like to say
Is a windy day
Through turbines spinning
<br>

A gentle hum between power pylons
Loosely strung in pearls and finches
The summer sun in garnet glare
Behind the tree line stare
<br>

Her feet moving beyond the green
Turning away toward the face of the wind
Away toward the end
Or the exit of your planet
Still spinning in her absence
<br>

Night below zero
Motion frozen staring at nothing
Clearest biting weather
And the multitude is turning above
Without a care
Like a flock of stars and crystal feathers
