title: rainlings meditation
---

on rails in station
stuck to paper headers feathers
and tar
like stationary
business mandate
compulsory
<!--excerpt-->

repulsive
our gazes
locked to one shadow
burning sharp and bright
as taillights
at night

short meditations
on wants needs and cravings
like rainlings
little fingers
tracing
the paths of drops
coming down from
the clouds

in glass and
steady sand coming
down from the
clouds of
time

we meditate
and mediate
between hate
and the absence of
self

back and forth
rhythm
take me
through the end
of this
burning
shadow
