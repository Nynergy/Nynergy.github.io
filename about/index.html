            </div>
            <div class="about-description right">
                <small><em>Lexica Chromatica</em> is the personal website of Ben
                Buchanan. That's me. Hello, I am writing this, I am Ben. I made
                this website to serve as an archive of things I find
                interesting, or for projects, or other assorted thoughts I'm
                having. You can find various poems that I upload and links to
                my published collections of poetry on the aptly-named "Poetry"
                page. Some scattered (and often unfinished) prose pieces can be
                found on the "Prose" page. My half-baked, malformed, and
                otherwise insubstantial music projects can be found on the
                "Music" page. I sometimes do a regular Internet thing and write
                blog posts, which you can find on the "Blog" page. If the other
                excrutiatingly monotonous creative projects on the site weren't
                enough for you, feel free to peruse my digital image galleries
                on the "Gallery" page. For more information about <em>Lexica
                Chromatica</em> and myself, head over to the "About" page. If
                you're not currently on the "About" page, then please tell me how
                you're reading this, I cannot fathom how it would be possible
                outside of a webscraping application.</small>

                <small>As you can tell from the long-winded and frankly
                unnecessary explanation above, I like to keep things simple
                here. Pages are appropriately named and easy to navigate
                to/from. There's a navbar at the top of the page, use it
                well. I do not place advertisements on my website - outside
                of foisting my books and other projects on you, of course.
                I try to make things look nice without creating too much
                clutter to sift through. Hopefully you appreciate the site
                in the same way I have come to. If you have any comments,
                tips, questions, etc, then send me an email with the
                contact form at the bottom of this page.</small>

            <div class="about-description left">
                <small>I'm a writer, author, poet, musician, artist, whatever the
                hell people are calling things these days. I do stuff in my
                spare time and I have a lot of fun with it. You can see some of
                the fruits of my work on this very website, be it my poetry,
                prose, music, or image galleries. I write blog posts, too, but
                that's not very creative. Mostly just me spouting endless inane
                nonsense until I tire of writing anything more. Sometimes I
                just want to see that "Recent Posts" table shift down a bit,
                you know what I mean?</small>

                <small>You can see some older poems I've written (most of which are
                reaching the ripe old age of "cringe-inducing" at this point)
                by going to my Instagram. My poetry Instagram, that is. I have
                a separate account for my personal stuff, but you're more than
                welcome to check that out as well if you feel so inclined.
                Links for both are down below.</small>

                <small>So you weren't fooled by all that stuff about being a
                creative, huh? That's fair. In reality, I'm a developer at a
                local campus IT department, making little web applications and
                tools for people. And if that wasn't enough for you, I also
                make my own open source projects on Github. You can find a link
                to my Github page below.</small>

                <small>I guess if you want an actual answer for what I do, I'm a
                full-time code monkey, if you will. And it's that primate
                knowledge that's allowed me to make this website, so at least I
                have something to show for it.</small>

                <small>Also I have a Twitter, I guess? You kids and your fancy
                social media. Much like my Instagram, I don't plan to post too
                much; I really just use it to follow and keep up with friends
                and the like. Feel free to contact me there if you want. You can
                find the link to my profile down below.</small>
