    My name is Ben Buchanan, and I made the stuff you're looking at on this
    site. Sometimes I write, sometimes I make music, sometimes I create art.
    Perhaps I might spend a week straight programming some tool or interface.
    Or maybe I'll spend far too much time ignoring this site and playing video
    games and online riichi mahjong.
    </p>

    <p>
    I also have a day job where I type on a keyboard and sit in a nice office
    chair. Not every day is a creative one, and that's okay.
    </p>

    <p>
    I hope you enjoy the stuff I make, or find something interesting on the
    site. Thanks for visiting, and be well.
